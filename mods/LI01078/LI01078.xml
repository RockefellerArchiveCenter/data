  <abstract>Rigoberta Menchu, winner of the 1992 Nobel Peace Prize, was born in a remote and impoverished corner of Guatemala, where her people, the Quiche-Mayan, suffered as second-class citizens. Those who tried to fight for their land and their rights often faced violence and even death. But Rigoberta, who worked as a coffee picker when she was a child and as a maid when she was a teenager, found the courage to become a leader in her people's struggle. Her tireless work has led to awareness and improvements of the lives of indigenous people--not only in Guatemala, but around the globe.</abstract>
