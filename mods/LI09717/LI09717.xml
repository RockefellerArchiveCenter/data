  <abstract>Abstract: 	Teachers for a New Era (TNE) is one of the latest efforts aimed at teacher education reform. Eleven institutions participate in TNE, which emphasizes evidence-based decisionmaking, collaboration between education and arts and sciences faculty, and teaching as an academically taught clinical-practice profession. The authors studied the 11 TNE sites to examine the process by which reform will result in highly qualified teachers capable of producing improvements in student learning.
Contents: 	Introduction -- TNE in the context of the broader teacher education reform effort -- TNE's theory of change: assumptions, enabling factors, and potential outcomes -- Profiles of the TNE institutions -- Implementation progress and thoughts about sustainability of TNE -- Conclusions.</abstract>
