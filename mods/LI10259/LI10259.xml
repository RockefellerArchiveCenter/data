  <abstract>An unparalleled introduction to American folk art, accompanying a major traveling exhibition. A handsome and insightful survey of American folk art, this book includes paintings, sculptures, furniture, and household objects made by untrained or minimally trained folk artists in New England, the Midwest, and the South between 1800 and the 1920s. This richly illustrated volume includes rare and very fine portraits, radiant still lives and landscapes, a mature version of The Peaceable Kingdom by Edward Hicks, playful animal sculptures and trade signs, and ornately painted German American furniture. With newly researched texts by leading scholars, this publication makes an important contribution to the field</abstract>
