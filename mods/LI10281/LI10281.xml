  <abstract>In a series of personal anecdotes, supplemented by photographs, essays, and manuscripts, The Sound of Drums is a memoir of celebrated Cherokee artist, fashion designer, and educator Lloyd Kiva New (1916-2002). An important figure in Native American art, design, and pedagogy, New inspired thousands of artists and students during his career. Humble beginnings in rural Oklahoma spawned an obsession with nature and a connection to his Cherokee roots--a connection he sought to strengthen throughout his life, The Sound of Drums.</abstract>
