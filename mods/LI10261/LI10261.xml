The foundations' efforts on behalf of American interests abroad have focused primarily on their support for a number of institutions of higher education in strategically located Third World nations. These institutions, modeled after foundation-supported American universities, were designed to train Third World leaders in norms that would encourage them—minimally—to assume a posture of neutrality toward American economic and political penetration of their societies.</abstract><subject authority="Library of Congress Subject Headings"><topic>Endowments--United States--Philanthropy</topic></subject><subject authority="Library of Congress Subject Headings"><topic>United States--Foreign Relations</topic></subject><subject authority="lcsh"><topic>Ford Foundation</topic></subject><subject authority="lcsh"><topic>Rockefeller Foundation</topic></subject><subject authority="lcsh"><topic>Carnegie family</topic></subject><identifier type="isbn">0-87395-725-3</identifier><genre/><classification>327.7  BER</classification></mods>
