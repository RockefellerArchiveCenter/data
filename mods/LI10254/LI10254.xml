  <abstract>For this compelling and fascinating collection, O'Shaughnessy gathers interviews with everyone from Tony Bennett on the singer's art to Ed Koch on the art of politics. Essays and talks from luminaries ranging from Henry Kissinger to Larry King, Rudolph Giuliani to Tim Russert and Dan Rather. There are moving pieces on the impact of September 11, vivid sketches of movers and shakers, and provocative, deeply felt calls for protecting freedoms of the First Amendment. And Mario Cuomo's moving thoughts on how to restore justice and wisdom to America's political culture.From color sketches of local pols to intimate conversations with great writers and artists, Again! Again! Is an endlessly fascinating portrait our time and place-marked as always by Bill O'Shaughnessy's intelligence, insight, and eloquence.</abstract>
