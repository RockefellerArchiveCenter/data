    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The albums in this collection primarily contain images of David Rockefeller (DR) with his family, friends, personal office staff, or Chase Manhattan Bank colleagues during his travels throughout the globe. A second common album theme is DR with Peggy, his wife, at one of their homes: Hudson Pines in Pocantico Hills, New York; their townhouse on East 65th Street in Manhattan; Ringing Point in Seal Harbor, Maine; or Colombier, on St. Bart's, in the Caribbean. However, there are also hundreds of images from DR's childhood and from his service in Europe during World War II.</p><p>The timeframe of the albums ranges from as early as DR's infancy, approximately starting in 1916, and goes throughout his lifetime, with the last album created in 2016. Of particular note are the albums from David's youth, including images he took while on family vacations. During his undergraduate years (mid-1930s), he traveled in Europe with his camera in hand. Then during World War II, he was stationed with the U.S. Army in France and took images while on leave in several countries.</p><p>By the 1950s, DR traveled internationally on behalf of his employer, Chase Manhattan Bank. The albums of his visits to several African nations are among the earliest images documenting those activities. His interest in Latin America is evident as early as the 1950s in this collection. After his retirement in 1980, DR continued to represent Chase Bank as a member of its International Advisory Committee (IAC), which led to further travel and albums from many of those trips. In the latter part of the 20th century, DR was described as an unofficial diplomat for the United States. The images found throughout this collection that depict his numerous meetings with heads of state attest to this informal but significant capacity and the lasting connections he made in all of his roles.</p><p>For each box, the contents of the album within are broadly described, along with details on the number of images and approximate date. Most images are prints, although there is a large aggregate of slides from mid-century. All images are in color unless otherwise noted.</p><p>Lastly, the albums with material related to living members of the Rockefeller family are restricted from research access during each individual's lifetime. Therefore, approximately 45 percent of the collection of albums remains restricted at this time even though there is description available in this finding aid. The archival staff will conduct periodic reviews to open additional albums and update this finding aid.</p>  </scopecontent>
  <arrangement id="77bb5ccb861de33be6f81bd38ceef2e0">
    <head>Arrangement</head>
<p>Arranged as received. These albums are in no discernible order, although some portions of the finding aid reflect semi-alphabetical runs of travel destinations. Sometimes trips to the same location over a range of years are in consecutive boxes, but that is not the general rule. At times, similar formats are grouped in a range of boxes. For example, most of the slides are located between Box 279 and Box 292, although a few are elsewhere in this collection. Albums on specific destinations (such as Seal Harbor, Maine) or events (such as DR's 100th birthday celebrations) appear throughout the collection.</p>  </arrangement>
