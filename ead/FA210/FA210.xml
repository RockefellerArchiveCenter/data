    <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
<p>The Population Council was founded by John D. Rockefeller 3rd in 1952 to undertake "significant activities in the broad field of population." Its goal has been to bring about a reduction in the number of births that occur in the world. In Its early years, the business of the Population Council was conducted by a Demographic Division and a Biomedical Division. Through its Demographic Division, the Council sought to document what it conceived to be an overpopulation problem threatening many areas of the world. To accomplish this purpose, the Division facilitated research on the economic, social, and psychological factors which affect the growth and decline of human population. This Council-assisted research effort was conducted not only by staff of the Demographic Division but also by other institutions and scholars, some of whom received Council grants and fellowships and some of whom received informal advice and consultation on how to design and execute studies.</p><p>The Biomedical Division, which, beginning in 1959, occupied a laboratory at The Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research (now The Rockefeller University), has conducted pure and applied research on plant, animal, and human reproductive physiology and on the development, the physiological action, and the safety and effectiveness of contraceptive methods. The Council facilitated similar types of medical research by non-Council scientists at other institutions by giving grants and fellowships for such research. The Council's biomedical research and its support for research by non-Council scientists were instrumental in the development of the modern intrauterine coil and the birth control pill.</p><p>In about 1960, the scope of Population Council activities expanded. The Council began to render practical and technical aid to foreign nations. Beginning in that year, the Demographic Division, in addition to supervising research, became involved in Pakistan's family planning program, extending practical and technical aid in organizing and running a national family planning program. By 1964 the Council's Demographic Division had assisted in organizing family planning programs in South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Tunisia, and Turkey. In that year, the Council created the Technical Assistance Division. This division, in ensuing years, continued the assistance of the Council in the countries where it had already become involved and also helped start and run programs in India, Morocco, the Philippines, and Puerto Rico.</p><p>An underlying aim of the Council's grant programs has been to encourage the development and growth of institutions that would promote family planning programs. To this end, the Council has given grants and advice to various universities and research centers for starting and upgrading programs for demographic and biomedical training and research programs; has assisted the United Nations to set up and expand regional Demographic Training and Research Centres in Bombay, India, Santiago, Chile, and Cairo, Egypt; has worked with the Ford Foundation on family planning programs in Pakistan, India, and North Africa.</p><p>In addition to rendering technical aid and sponsoring research, the Council has undertaken several complementary public relations efforts. To reach the general populations of the United States and of foreign nations, Council officers have worked to inform the mass media about population issues and to encourage magazine articles, movies, and books dealing with population matters. Council officers and representatives have also made trips and prepared reports to convince various foreign government leaders of the importance and the desirability of promulgating family planning programs. In addition, Council officers participated in and helped organize and finance conferences for demographers and medical scientists active in population work.</p><p>The Population Council has obtained its financial support through large contributions. The Ford and Rockefeller Foundations and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund have been the principal institutional supporters of the Council. John D. Rockefeller 3rd has been the single most significant individual backer of the Council.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
<p>The records of the Population Council document its day-to-day operation as an organization that, among other activities, evaluated and administered grants, sponsored conferences of scholars in the field of population control, and provided advice to individuals, private institutions, and governments concerned with population. There is some material relating to major policy decisions of the Council. There are also letters and reports from scientists involved in medical research and from Council staff members and representatives involved in family planning activities abroad.</p><p>The Council records are divided into two accessions. Accession 1, most of which is dated before 1967, consists of material received by the Archive Center in September, 1976. Accession 2, most of which is dated after 1966, consists primarily of material received by the Center in April, 1977.</p><p>The records of Accession 1 and Accession 2 have been kept separate because the Council evidently employed different filing systems in each of the two units and because the existence of the different filing systems sheds light on the manner in which the Council was organized and run. The use of this approach has meant that the files are organized in such a way that material relating to a given topic may appear in several different parts of the collection under either identical names or titles, or under different names or titles. For example, in the case of some institutions whose proper names are in a foreign language, records may have been filed under both the foreign name and under an English rendering of the name. The files also contain many carbon copies and there is duplication throughout the collection, so that copies of the same item may appear in several places.</p><p>To conduct a thorough search for records on a given topic, it is essential to look for material in as many different sections of the collection and under as many different names or titles as possible. For example, material relating to a given organization may be listed under the name of the organization, under the name of important figures in the organization, or under a title reflecting a study or type of work done by the organization.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Custodial History note</head>
<p>The description of the records of the Population Council was written in 1978 when the described records, designated as Accession 1, were initially processed and opened to researchers. In accordance with the criteria developed at that time, certain documents and files were closed from scholarly access.</p><p>In January 2001, those criteria were reevaluated. Subsequent to the review of all the closed files, new guidelines for the continued closure of Accession 1 records were established. The revised criteria specified that continued closure was warranted only for records that revealed names of patients or participants in medical studies. Additionally, all personnel files were to remain closed.</p><p>The new, less stringent closure guidelines allowed for the opening of dozens of files that had previously been closed to research. These files are easily identifiable throughout the collection. The word "CLOSED," which had been written in red pencil at the top of the folder, now has a red line through it. Furthermore, these previously closed folders have been stamped "Open as of July 2001."</p><p>Those files that have remained closed are no longer intermingled with the open records. They are, instead, filed at the end of Accession I in boxes 129 and 130.</p>  </custodhist>

They also include letters and reports which summarize studies undertaken with grant support. Many grant files are very brief, and for some grants only the grant authorization or the letter of award may be available. Almost always researchers have applied for and received grants through the institutions with which they were affiliated. The institutions administered the grants for the benefit of the individual researcher(s) undertaking the study described in the grant proposal.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="471fd966d4be4c196a1f4693af0b5431"><head>Arrangement note</head><p>Grant Files are arranged by number with the exception of a few unnumbered grants which are filed by year at the front of the file. Grant numbers have two parts, separated by a decimal point. The digits to the left of the decimal point designate the year in which a grant was made. The digits to the right of the decimal point designate the order in which grants were awarded during a given year. A letter M, D, or T, indicates whether the grant was made under the aegis of the Biomedical Division, the Demographic Division, or the Technical Assistance Division, respectively.</p><p>For example, M65.34 - signifies the thirty-fourth grant of 1965. The letter M indicates that the grant was for biomedical research. For a single year, there is one series of grant numbers in which medical, demographic, and technical grants are included. For example, M65.34 - would be followed by a grant numbered 65.35. That grant could be either a medical, demographic, or technical grant.</p></arrangement><fileplan id="944de46c77d51a13efb28738dbc0d5bb"><head>File Plan note</head><p>Former Classification: IV 3B 04.3a</p></fileplan><odd id="0e41412c24f6c70e1e80934958801970"><head>General</head><p>Indexing to the Grant Files is provided by <extref href="../FA775/contents">FA775 Population Council records, Index</extref>, Series 2: Central File Index, 1961-1976.</p></odd><c id="5d012a227d724b35a7e0098f4f175baa" level="file"><did><unittitle>University of Washington: Fellowships</unittitle><unitdate normal="1958/1958" type="inclusive">1958</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="a3e2fead264f8af14128ce185814aa67" label="mixed materials [A0000000068447]" type="box">45</container><container id="98c3ed10df5029b24962f6ea318686f4" parent="a3e2fead264f8af14128ce185814aa67" type="folder">631</container></did></c><c id="c505014074d34213b8a2f84ca647c714" level="file"><did><unittitle>Mt.

The NCMH, under its Director of Research, Dr. Christopher Tietze, worked very closely with the Population Council, functioning as an information service for people and organizations interested in family planning and as a source of expert advice for scholars conducting demographic and medical research.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="8aa959acadf4c709b2a3b9a0de3cf8fe"><head>Arrangement note</head><p>Arranged so that large amounts of material concerning a given person, institution, or subject are stored together in one of more folders. Such material is arranged in chronological order, and the folders appear in appropriate alphabetical order throughout the General Correspondence for a given year. For each letter of the alphabet, a general folder has been used for small amounts of material filed under that letter. Material in these folders is filed alphabetically. The general folder for each letter precedes all folders that are filed under that letter and that deal with specific subjects, persons, or institutions.</p><p>In some instances folders of correspondence of a given year contain material from previous or subsequent years. For example, a folder labeled "1959 General Correspondence / F, 1957-1959" contains material going back to 1957. The folder would appear among the 1959 general correspondence. If, then, a user of the NCMH papers is looking for 1958 correspondence with John Flynt, he or she should consult the "F" folders for both 1958 and 1959.
