<p>The Davison Fund, Inc. was established by John D. Rockefeller, Jr. in 1934, to systematize his personal giving. The establishment contained no instruction as to beneficiaries, nor any limitation as to field. The beneficiaries selected by the Fund were regarded as a means to an end, the effective application of resources for charitable purposes. In general, the program developed from two motivations: an interest in the social, cultural, educational, and health aspects of the citizens of New York City and its environs (including Westchester County); and "the recognition of the outstanding importance and wide significance of certain problems which cut across national and international boundaries and which invite the cooperation and support of thoughtful men everywhere." Its major interests were child welfare, medicine and health, the relief of distress, and the improvement of social conditions, especially with regard to poverty, race relations, and social services to African-Americans. Other subjects of note include education, missionaries, music, religion and urban policy.</p>  </bioghist>
