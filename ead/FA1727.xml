She also served as Chairman for the Executive Board of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) between 1978 and 1979. Ogata served as UN High Commissioner for Refugees during a period of numerous refugee crises such as the Gulf War, the Yugoslav Wars, and the Rwandan genocide.</p><p>
Following her time as Scholar in Residence at the Ford Foundation, Ogata continued her involvement with the UN. She served as the Chair of the Advisory Board on Human Security which was established on the recommendations put forth by the Commission on Human Security that she had co-chaired, and between 2006 and 2007, she served as a member of the Advisory Committee on Genocide Prevention.

Files document Ogata's work as Co-Chair of the United Nations Commission on Human Security (CHS) as well as her involvement in the larger international peace and governance field. </p><p>
Most of the files regarding the CHS appear to have been created in the context of its Third Meeting in June 2002 in Stockholm, Sweden. Nevertheless, these files and other ones in the series also contain materials that document the earlier history of the commission such as press releases announcing the formation of the CHS. Other records pertaining to the commission include correspondence, drafts, reports, talking points Ogata wrote for meetings, meeting agendas, and planning notes. They show how the CHS sought to organize itself, select candidates for commissioners, and research literature on human security. </p><p>
Other documents in the series provide evidence of Ogata's involvement with organizations and projects focusing on subjects such as refugees, children, and assistance to Afghanistan. Ogata served as Special Representative of the Prime Minister of Japan on Afghanistan Assistance during this time period. Much of Ogata's communication with scholars, professionals, and organizations concerned with international peace and governance was handled by Megumi Nakamura, her Personal Assistant based in Tokyo, Japan and by Claudia Fletcher, her Executive Administrative Assistant based in New York, New York. Correspondence, purchase records, and schedules created, maintained, and distributed by Nakamura and Fletcher document the communications Ogata had with different individuals and organizations as well as the meetings and conferences she attended. </p></scopecontent><c id="3c8ac46c764c4cb8c0e2efc87ce0f1d4" level="file"><did><unittitle>Commission on Human Security (CHS) Third Meeting, Stockholm,
