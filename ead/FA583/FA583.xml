      <abstract id="bb91416d0969b5bc86c75a4faa9bf0a0">Franklin Thomas joined the Ford Foundation in 1979 as the institution's seventh president, becoming the first African-American to head a major philanthropy. During his tenure, he initiated a Foundation-wide review, assessing grant making procedures and priorities, reorganizing Foundation departments and programs, cutting operating costs, and ultimately increasing the endowment to $5.8 billion. Mr. Thomas resigned in 1996 after seventeen years and was succeeded by Susan Berresford. The Office Files of Franklin Thomas span from 1968 to 1995 and document Mr. Thomas' leadership as president of the Ford Foundation from 1979 to 1996. The collection is arranged into three series: correspondence files, international program files and domestic programs and grant funded initiatives. Correspondence, interoffice memoranda, grant proposals and reports highlight Mr. Thomas' involvement with Foundation employees and grant applicants. Of particular note are the reports and memoranda highlighting the Foundation's response to the Jennifer Harbury human rights case in Guatemala and the 1992 race riots in Los Angeles. Initiatives such as the Los Angeles Task Force formed in response to the riots, the Puerto Rico Community Foundation established in 1984 to funnel support to the island, and the myriad activities sponsored by the Foundation's field offices reveal efforts to eradicate the roots of social injustice by focusing on underrepresented populations and communities.</abstract>

      <head>Organizational History</head>
      <p>The Ford Foundation was formally established in 1936 by Edsel Ford, son of Henry Ford, to support "scientific, educational and charitable purposes, all for the public welfare." With the deaths of both Henry and Edsel Ford in the 1940s and the inheritance of their Ford Motor Company stock, the Foundation became the largest philanthropic institution in the world. Henry Ford II, the eldest son of Edsel Ford, commissioned H. Rowan Gaither to lead a seven member study to determine how best to operate the Foundation. The report presented to the Board of Directors in 1949 suggested that the Foundation seek to better social welfare across racial, ethnic, and cultural divides, both nationally and internationally.</p>
      <p>Following the resignation of Henry Ford II in 1950, the position of president transferred out of the Ford family. The board of directors decided to diversify the foundation's portfolio and gradually divested itself of its substantial Ford Motor Company stock between 1956 and 1974. Through this divestiture, the Ford Motor Company became publically held and the Foundation became independent of Ford and the Ford family.</p>
      <p>In 1979, Franklin Thomas was appointed as the seventh president of the Ford Foundation, becoming the first African-American to head a major philanthropy. Mr. Thomas promptly ordered a Foundation-wide review and restructuring of programs and their divisions. By the end of his third year the staff had decreased in size by over one hundred members in an effort to streamline work and cut operating costs. When Mr. Thomas assumed the presidency, the endowment had been steadily declining. By 1990 it had risen to $5.8 billion.</p>
      <p>Mr. Thomas resigned in 1996 and Susan Berresford, a long-standing Foundation employee, was chosen as his successor, making her the organization's first female president. Ms. Berresford was followed by Luis Ubinas in 2008.</p>

      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Franklin Thomas was born on May 27, 1934 to James and Viola Thomas. Raised in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York, Mr. Thomas attended Franklin K. Lane High School where he excelled in both academics and athletics. He was offered and rejected several sports scholarships in favor of an academic scholarship at Columbia University. Following his graduation in 1956, Mr. Thomas entered the Air Force. During the next four years he rose to the rank of captain and served as a navigator on missions with the Strategic Air Command.</p>
      <p>Mr. Thomas left the Air Force in 1960 and earned an LLB from Columbia University in 1963. He subsequently worked as an attorney for the Federal Housing and Home Finance Agency, the assistant U.S. attorney in New York, and the deputy police commissioner of New York in charge of legal affairs. In 1967, New York state senator Robert Kennedy met with Mr. Thomas to discuss an agency then in development designed to improve the economic and social welfare of the Bedford-Stuyvesant community. In May 1967, Mr. Thomas accepted the presidency of the Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation. He remained at the Corporation for ten years, during which time he raised over $60 million for community development and restoration with assistance from the Ford Foundation. Mr. Thomas' work became a model for later urban renewal programs.</p>
      <p>While president of the Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, Mr. Thomas served on the boards of several major corporations and institutions, including CBS, Citicorp/Citibank, AT&amp;T, and the Cummins Engine Company, and as a trustee of the Ford Foundation. In 1976, he declined President-elect Jimmy Carter's offer of an appointment as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.</p>
      <p>Mr. Thomas resigned from the Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation to pursue a career in private practice. When the Ford Foundation offered Mr. Thomas the position of president in 1979, he accepted. He reassessed the Foundation's grant-making procedures, reconsidered grant-making priorities, and redefined the areas of social and cultural activity most in need of Foundation attention. Grants offered by the Foundation during Mr. Thomas' tenure emphasized tangible results, rather than theoretical studies of issues. Under him, the Foundation also limited its practice of funding the operating expenses of small community groups and increased financial support for larger programs with wider recipient bases. One such program established by Mr. Thomas was the Local Initiative Support Corporation (LISC), an organization designed to help small community development programs command large scale projects. Mr. Thomas retired from the Ford Foundation in 1996 after seventeen years of leadership. Since his retirement he has served as a consultant for the TFF Study Group (The Ford Foundation), a non-profit aid organization dedicated to South Africa. He has also chaired the September 11th Fund and functioned as a director of Lucent Technologies and Pepsico.</p>

      <head>Processing Information Note</head>
      <p>This collection was created by merging two related collections of Franklin Thomas office files separately accessioned by the Ford Foundation Archives in 2011. The smaller collection, comprising a cubic foot and accessioned as ACC2011/012, was merged into the larger collection which was two cubic feet in size. The total original volume of three cubic feet was reduced during processing to 2.4 cubic feet and transferred to six Hollinger document boxes.</p>
      <p>The original arrangement of Mr. Thomas' office files was preserved. Two large file folders originally labeled "Miscellaneous" have been arranged and added to the Correspondence series as miscellaneous files. Form letters responding to requests for employment or requests for Mr. Thomas to speak at or attend various events have been weeded from the collection. A sampling of the thank you notes has been retained. Reference and background materials provided by grant applicants, as well as duplicates of grant proposals, grantee reports, and memoranda were not retained.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
      <p>The Office Files of Franklin Thomas span from 1968 to 1995 and document Mr. Thomas' tenure as president of the Ford Foundation from 1979 to 1996. Correspondence, interoffice memoranda, grant proposals and reports detail the activities of Ford staff and grant recipients and highlight Mr. Thomas' own close involvement with Foundation employees and grant applicants.</p>
      <p>The correspondence series underscores the enormous volume of mail Mr. Thomas received as president, and the attempt his office made to respond. Mr. Thomas' international, domestic and grant-related program files highlight the Ford Foundation's work in the United States and abroad during his time in office. They chart major events and conflicts, from civil war in Guatemala to race riots and political unrest in Los Angeles, and illustrate the Foundation's response to such crises both at the New York headquarters and at its branch offices.</p>

          <p>Mr. Thomas' chronological files comprise the bulk of the correspondence. The records contain thank you notes and letters of appreciation to correspondents unaffiliated with the Ford Foundation. These notes record the lectures, conferences, and events to which Mr. Thomas was invited to attend as well as the books, reports, and miscellaneous items he received while president of the Foundation.</p>
          <p>Mr. Thomas had also assembled several subject and miscellaneous correspondence files, and his arrangement has been preserved. The subject files are arranged in alphabetical order and address Mr. Thomas' involvement with the Carter Center, the Center for Effective Philanthropy, and the Independent Sector.

          <head>Scope and Contents</head>
          <p>Correspondence, inter-office memoranda, reports, and meeting materials help illustrate the Foundation's work in Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean during Mr. Thomas' tenure and provide a documentary record of the establishment, upkeep, and periodic relocation of overseas field offices. There are also materials pertaining to program directors and officers such as Enid B. Schoettle, Shepard Forman, Peter Geithner, and William Carmichael. Foundation initiatives described in the International Program Files address issues of governance and social policy, disarmament and arms control, economic and educational reform, women's rights, reproductive health and population control, food production, and land and natural resource management. Of particular note is the file containing Jennifer Harbury's communication with the Foundation's Mexico City office. Harbury, an American lawyer and the wife of a Guatemalan revolutionary kidnapped by the Guatemalan government during his country's civil war, demanded answers regarding the whereabouts of her husband and hoped to collaborate with the Ford Foundation on a project to combat human rights abuses.</p>

          <p>The third and final series of the collection contains correspondence, inter-office memoranda, grant recommendations, reports, meeting and background materials, and additional items pertaining to the Foundation's domestic programs and grant-funded initiatives. This series is arranged alphabetically by program name. Among those documented are the Foundation's Los Angeles Task Force and Scholar in Residence programs, the National Arts Stabilization Fund, the New York City Partnership, and the Puerto Rico Community Foundation. Of particular significance are the records regarding the Foundation's immediate response to the 1992 Los Angeles race riots and the reports produced by the Foundation's L.A. task force emphasizing both the underlying causes of the riots and the possible prevention of future incidents.</p>
