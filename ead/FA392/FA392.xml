      <p>Rockefeller Foundation diaries:</p>
      <p>Officers of the Rockefeller Foundation in New York and its staff members in the field often visited educational, scientific and research institutions and laboratories in many parts of the world to maintain contacts and assess work being done. Officers and field staff frequently conferred with government officials regarding the operation of the RF's programs. In order to preserve accurate records for the guidance of other RF officers, those who carried on these activities kept diaries of their day-to-day contacts and impressions. These diaries were sent to the RF office, where they circulated among officers and staff to the extent deemed advisable.</p>
      <p>Rockefeller Foundation:</p>
      <p>The Rockefeller Foundation was established by act of the New York State Legislature approved by the Governor on May 14, 1913, "to promote the well-being of mankind throughout the world." Between 1913 and 1928 the China Medical Board, the International Health Board, and the Division of Medical Education functioned as divisions of the Foundation, concentrating on the administration of programs in public health and medical education. A Division of Studies was created in 1923 to handle projects outside the medical field. These early years were experimental as the new foundation studied the methods of philanthropy and explored its relationships with other Rockefeller boards.</p>
      <p>Although the Rockefeller Foundation is the largest and best known philanthropy founded by the Rockefeller family, it was neither the first nor the last to be established. The Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research (1901), the General Education Board (1902), the Rockefeller Sanitary Commission for the Eradication of Hookworm Disease (1909), and the Bureau of Social Hygiene (1911) all existed earlier. When the Foundation was created, the Sanitary Commission was disbanded. After the establishment of the Foundation, the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial (1918) and the International Education Board (1923) were created.</p>
      <p>The Rockefeller boards and their programs were reconsidered and reorganized in 1927-1928 in order to avoid overlapping programs. The International Health Board of the Foundation was disbanded and an International Health Division was organized. The China Medical Board, Inc., was established as a separately incorporated institution, and the China Medical Board of the Foundation ceased to exist. The Division of Studies was dropped and the Division of Medical Education was phased out. The Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial was combined with the Foundation and the Spelman Fund of New York was chartered to continue activities of the LSRM that were not absorbed by the Foundation. The International Education Board was disbanded.</p>
      <p>As a result of this reorganization, the Foundation adopted a program which included public health work (administered by the IHD), the advancement of knowledge in the medical and natural sciences (in part taken over from the IEB), the social sciences (formerly the field of the LSRM), and the humanities and arts (shared with the GEB). The Rockefeller Institute and the Bureau of Social Hygiene were not affected by the reorganization. The program adopted by the Foundation at this time remained basically the same for the next twenty years.</p>
      <p>As its files accumulated, the Foundation maintained a card index recording the names of institutional and individual grantees and correspondents. A microfilm copy of this index is available at the Archive Center.</p>

      <p>Rockefeller Foundation officers' diaries:</p>
      <p>Diaries are of two types: regular daily diaries, and special trip diaries. Some diaries have indexes, which are bound in the annual volume; indexing was not a requirement but was left to the discretion of the officers, and not all diaries are indexed.</p>
      <p>Diaries frequently contain information given in confidence, and were thus treated as confidential., The period covered is approximately 1911-1992.</p>

          <p>Edwin Rogers Embree was an early voice championing the Rockefeller Foundation's (RF) expansion into the humanities and social sciences.</p>
          <p>Born in Osceola, Nebraska in 1883, Embree moved with his family to the racially integrated town of Berea, Kentucky in 1891. His formative childhood years in Berea and his family's abolitionist history shaped his lifelong commitment to racial equality.</p>
          <p>Embree received his B.A. from Yale University in 1906. He spent a year in New York City as a reporter for the New York Sun before returning to New Haven in 1907. He spent the following decade working at Yale first as assistant editor of the Yale Alumni Weekly and then in several university administrative positions, while also earning an M.A. degree from the university in 1914. Embree's administrative work at Yale brought him to the attention of the Rockefeller Foundation, and in 1917 he was appointed secretary of the RF under president George E. Vincent.</p>
          <p>When Embree joined the RF, the Foundation’s efforts were focused primarily on medicine and public health projects. Embree advocated for expanding their work into the humanities and social sciences. In a rousing 1924 address to RF Trustees and the General Education Board, he asked, "Of what good is it to keep people alive and healthy if their lives are not to be touched increasingly with something of beauty?" His speech received a lukewarm response from the Trustees, however. Embree instead channeled his efforts into directing the newly formed Division of Studies (DS), which was created in 1924 to administer all Foundation work in areas outside of medicine and public health. When the DS was eliminated in 1927, Embree went on to serve briefly as the RF's vice president. His vision for a robust humanities and social sciences program would not be fully realized until after his departure from the RF in 1928. That same year, the Foundation reorganized and established a Division of Humanities and a Division of Social Sciences.</p>
          <p>Embree left the RF in 1928 to become president of the Julius Rosenwald Fund, which supported educational, public health, and welfare programs for African Americans. When the Fund closed after expending all of its funds in 1948, Embree went on to serve as president of the Liberian and Africa Foundations, collectively focused on improving health, education, and welfare in Africa.</p>
          <p>In addition to his long philanthropic career, Embree was a prolific author. He wrote numerous articles, essays, and several books including Brown America: The Story of a New Race (1931), Brown Americans: The Story of a Tenth of the Nation (1943), and Thirteen Against the Odds (1944).</p>
          <p>Edwin Rogers Embree died in New York City on February 21, 1950, at the age of 66.</p>

          <p>Born in North Carolina, John Atkinson Ferrell (1880-1965) received both his B.S. (1902) and M.D. (1907) from The University of North Carolina. Ferrell next matriculated to Johns Hopkins where he earned a Ph.D. in 1919. Feller later received an LL.D degree from the University of North Carolina, the North Carolina Distinguished Service Award and the recognition of an Honorary Fellow from the Royal Institute of Public Health.</p>
          <p>Ferrell began his career as a teacher in Sampson County, North Carolina. Rising through the categories, Ferrell transitioned from a medical practitioner and County Superintendent, to the Superintendent of Health for Duplin Country, N.C. and later, the Assistant Secretary for the State Board of Health. In 1944, John Atkinson Ferrell became the Medical Director for the John and Mary Markle Foundation before ultimately assuming the role of the Executive Secretary for the North Carolina Medical Care Commission.
    
In and among his professional career, Ferrell was an active member of numerous associations and organizations. From 1910 to 1913, John Ferrell acted as the State Director for the Rockefeller Sanitary Commission for the Eradication of Hookworm Disease. Subsequently, he assumed the role of Associate Director of the International Health Division of the Rockefeller Foundation for a lengthy thirty-one years, ranging from 1913-1944. During this time, Ferrell published Hookworm Disease; Its Ravages, Prevention and Cure in a Rockefeller Foundation Publication. It is also important to note that Ferrell published his writing on Wickliffe Rose, who acted as the Executive Secretary of the Rockefeller Sanitary Commission for the Eradication of Hookworm Disease from 1910-1915 and the General Director of the International Health Board for the Rockefeller foundation from 1913-1923.</p>
          <p>Apart from his work with the Rockefellers, Ferrell served as Chairman for the National Malaria Committee, the American Public Health Association and the American Medical Association. Moreover, Ferrell was a member of the Royal Institute of Public Health in Great Britain, the Medical Society of North Carolina (Secretary, 1912-1915), the Medical Society of Union County N.J., the Cosmos Club of Washington D.C., the Town Hall Club of New York and the Delta Omega professional honor society.</p>

            <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
            <p>This diary is both a travelogue and report of Dr. Ferrell’s 1915 trip to British Honduras (Belize), Guatemala, and Salvador (El Salvador) on behalf of the International Health Board, providing his observations of the state of public health, economic life, and culture in the three Central American nations. In the diary, Dr. Ferrell inspects the clinical and public health facilities available to the native populations and reports that the government officials in each nation are eager for support from the IHB in establishing public health campaigns to eradicate Hookworm Disease, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. He also provides his endorsement for several native medical professionals who he believes would be indispensable to the IHB’s work in establishing native medical institutions and who would be deserving of IHB scholarships. Where statistical information is available, Dr. Ferrell collects figures on rates of infection and morbidity resulting from Hookworm disease, mostly from plantations in Guatemala and Salvador where the data is collected by corporate owners, the largest being the United Fruit Company, whose facilities in Guatemala are extensively reported on. Dr. Ferrell also reports on his time in Guatemala and Salvador as the guest and colleague of Dr. Walter H. Rowan, Director of the Guatemalan branch of the International Health Board, who helps him to secure an agreement with the Consejo Superior de Salubridad (National Department of Health) for the immediate establishment of an IHB public health campaign in the Republic of Salvador.</p>

            <p>This diary provides Dr. Ferrell’s observations on the state of public health affairs in Mexico on the federal, state, and local level. Visiting Mexico City, Jalapa, and Tierra Blanca, he is given a tour by Dr. Henry P. Carr, who is in charge of the RF’s Mexican operations, and Dr. Jose Zozaya, Director of the Institute of Hygiene, of the recently built federal, state, and local public health facilities. Ferrell’s summary of the tour suggests that these facilities are extravagantly built, taxing on Mexico’s strained economy and government budgets, and highlight the lack of cooperation between federal, state, and local authorities. This concern is expressed in Dr. Ferrell’s final recommendations, where he also praises the work of Dr. Carr, which has led to a “sanitary triumph” in Mexico, and suggests shifting operational focus from Hookworm Disease to Malaria containment.</p>

          <p>Raymond B. Fosdick was a man with philanthropic interests and great administrative talents who played an instrumental role in directing the Rockefeller Foundation (RF).</p>
          <p>Fosdick was born in Buffalo, New York, in 1883. He pursued his post-secondary education at Princeton University, receiving his B.A. in 1905 and his M.A. in 1906. His decision to study at Princeton helped to set the trajectory of his career. While there, he met and befriended Woodrow Wilson, who was then president of the University. Wilson’s internationalist philosophy and interest in social problems had a profound effect in shaping Fosdick’s worldview and, later, his term of leadership at the RF.</p>
          <p>While still a student, Fosdick visited New York City’s Lower East Side. The living conditions of many of the city’s immigrant families appalled him, and after graduating from Princeton, he took a position at the Henry Street Settlement, which provided social services to poor families in that neighborhood. Fosdick continued to work there while also pursuing a law degree, which he received from New York Law School in 1908.</p>
          <p>Upon completing law school, Fosdick took a position as investigator for the City of New York. It was here, while investigating white slavery, that he met John D. Rockefeller, Jr. (JDR Jr.), who was at that time working with a special grand jury tasked with investigating the same issue.</p>
          <p>In 1913 Fosdick was hired by JDR Jr. to head up a study for the newly created Bureau of Social Hygiene (BSH). The Bureau was created following JDR Jr.’s work as a member of the grand jury, and it was tasked with the study and prevention of a number of social ills related to urban poverty, including prostitution, venereal disease, and crime. He was hired to conduct a study focusing on European law enforcement, which was published as European Police Systems in 1916, but a follow-up study on American police systems was halted because of World War I.</p>
          <p>In 1917 Fosdick took leave from the BSH when he was commissioned by the Secretary of War to study military training for the United States Army and Navy. Fosdick then went on to serve as a special representative of the War Department in France and as a civilian aide to General John J. Pershing.  At war’s end Fosdick formally resigned from the BSH upon being named Under-Secretary General to the League of Nations. While he firmly believed in the mandate of the League, he ultimately left the position in 1920 when the United States failed to ratify its membership in the organization.</p>
          <p>In 1920 Fosdick returned to the BSH and finally completed his long-delayed study on American police systems. He continued his close association with JDR Jr., serving as both his attorney and advisor. This relationship ultimately led to Fosdick’s prominent role in the Rockefeller family’s philanthropies.</p>
          <p>In 1921 Fosdick became a board member at the RF, the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research (RIMR), the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial (LSRM), the China Medical Board (CMB) and the International Health Division (IHD). One year later he was appointed a member of the General Education Board (GEB), and in 1923 he became a member of the International Education Board (IEB). As a trustee of the RF, Fosdick played a key role in the Foundation’s reorganization in 1928, and in 1936 he was named president of both the RF and GEB.</p>
          <p>As president of the RF, Fosdick, along with JDR Jr., shaped the direction of the organization between 1936 and 1948. In these years the organization contributed substantially to the research and control of malaria and yellow fever, as well as to the modernization of China and the development of the natural sciences. During this time the RF also developed its first programs in the humanities and social sciences, as well as a revolutionary program in agriculture in the hopes of expanding crop production worldwide.</p>
          <p>Fosdick’s work in public service and philanthropy resulted in many awards during his lifetime. These included the Distinguished Service Medal for his war work, and the titles of Commander in the French Legion of Honor and Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was also a prolific writer, authoring fourteen books, including The Story of the Rockefeller Foundation.</p>
          <p>Raymond B. Fosdick died at his home in Newtown, Connecticut, in 1972. He was 89 years old.</p>

            <p>This diary records Raymond Fosdick's correspondence and meetings with several influential and important Rockefeller Foundation Officers as well as several brief encounters with Nelson Rockefeller and John D. Rockefeller, Jr. The diary covers three subjects: the General Education Board, the Paris Office of the RF, and the Scientific Division of the RF. For the most part the journal describes the negotiations involved in disbursing RF funds for the General Education Board to colleges and universities and its endeavors in the African-American community in the American South. Fosdick also devotes a significant amount of time describing the opinions between American and British scientists and RF officers on how best to structure the Foundation's activities in Medical and Natural Sciences. Fosdick consults several experts on America's standing among the global scientific community in the fields of organic chemistry, biology, and physics. Furthermore, Fosdick consults with his fellow officers on the most efficient structure and governance of the Paris Office, which leads to a discussion on how the RF should interact with politically unfree nations such as Germany and Japan and how it should continue to conduct its work in those nations.</p>

            <p>This diary contains the memoranda and letters sent by Raymond Fosdick to his various contacts within the Rockefeller Foundation, specifically recounting conversations and decisions made on the continuation and direction of the Rockefeller Foundation's work in the medical, natural, and social sciences. As the diary covers the pre- and post-WW II period, there is significant discussion on the appropriate actions for the Foundation to take in the continuation of its activities during the war and after in China and Eastern Europe in the early stages of the Cold War. Fosdick also highlights the Foundation's significant contributions to atomic research through Ernest Lawrence and Warren Weaver and his belief that the atomic age would continue to shape the Foundation's work in each of its other departments. This diary also reveals Fosdick's desires to reorganize the Foundation's efforts in all its programs to have greater impact and relevance, especially in the areas of the General Education Board and the Division of Medical Science.</p>

          <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
          <p>Chadbourne Gilpatric's career as a Rockefeller Foundation (RF) officer in the humanities and social sciences was characterized by a remarkable intellectual curiosity. From 1949 to 1972, Gilpatric's work for the Foundation took him from New York City to New Delhi and spanned diverse interest areas including urban planning and design, university development, and agricultural education.</p>
          <p>Gilpatric was born on November 25, 1914 in Brooklyn, New York. He received his B.S. from Harvard University in 1937 and was a Rhodes Scholar at Balliol College, Oxford from 1938 to 1939. During World War II he served first on the Board of Economic Warfare, and then with the U.S. Army in the Office of Strategic Services. From 1947 to 1949 he was the Deputy Chief of Operations for the Central Intelligence Agency.</p>
          <p>Gilpatric's work with the Rockefeller Foundation began in 1949, when he was appointed Assistant Director for the Humanities. He was promoted to Associate Director for the Humanities in 1956, and held this position until 1961. In the late 1950s, Gilpatric played a vital role in the RF's post-World War II efforts to develop the urban design field by helping to facilitate intellectual exchange between influential architects, landscape architects, and city planners. In 1958, he began working closely with Architectural Forum editor Jane Jacobs, regularly soliciting her advice about urban studies grant proposals and potential grantees. Gilpatric also helped secure RF grants for Jacobs's own research and writing about urban design. The resulting book, The Death and Life of Great American Cities (1961), was a widely influential critique of postwar urban planning policy.</p>
          <p>Gilpatric served briefly as the RF's Deputy Director for the Humanities and Social Sciences in 1962, and then as Associate Director from 1963 to 1968. In 1963 Gilpatric took a one-year leave to become the Honorary Littauer Fellow at Harvard University, where he studied the cultural and civic importance of universities in urban areas. In the following years, this experience would influence his work in the RF field office in New Delhi, India.</p>
          <p>Gilpatric's RF assignments in the 1950s and early 1960s required repeated trips to South Asian countries including India and Pakistan. In 1964 Gilpatric moved full time to New Delhi, where he represented Foundation interests in the humanities and social sciences and served as a Visiting Professor of Philosophy at the University of Delhi. Between 1964 and 1967, Gilpatric worked to strengthen research, teaching, and libraries at Indian universities. In 1967, he shifted his focus to Indian agricultural education, and directed a study documenting the impact of changing agricultural conditions on small farmers in Uttar Pradesh state. He returned to the United States in 1972 to serve as the RF's Associate Director of Social Sciences, and retired shortly afterwards.</p>
          <p>Chadbourne Gilpatric died in 1989 at the age of 74.</p>

          <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
          <p>John B. Grant was born to Canadian missionaries in Ningbo, China, in 1890. He earned an undergraduate degree from Acadia University in Nova Scotia in 1912 and a medical degree from the University of Michigan in 1917. Throughout his career, Grant consistently emphasized community development as an essential component of medical care.</p>
          <p>Grant’s first contact with the Rockefeller Foundation (RF) came in 1918 when he worked with the RF’s International Health Division (IHD) on hookworm surveys in China and Puerto Rico. Upon his return Grant took a leave of absence from the Foundation to pursue a graduate degree in public health at Johns Hopkins University. After graduation he went back to the Foundation and was immediately assigned to China, where he became a professor of hygiene and public health at China’s Peking Union Medical College (PUMC). In addition to his teaching responsibilities, Grant promoted field work and established a number of community clinics where medical and nursing students could practice their skills. By 1926 Grant had become the head of PUMC’s Department of Public Health and Hygiene.</p>
          <p>In addition to his work with the university, Grant also nurtured relationships with municipal governments in various parts of China in order to help establish public health stations. His efforts led to the establishment of health stations in Shanghai and Canton and they helped to create a national ministry of health.</p>
          <p>Grant’s role in China was expanded in 1934 when he was asked to work with the RF’s newly developed China Program. The China Program took a comprehensive approach toward China’s development, focusing on areas as diverse, yet inter-related as health care, education and agriculture. Although it focused its activities in north China, the goal of the China Program was to create a model for rural development throughout the country. Grant remained with this program until 1939, when war with the Japanese eventually forced an end to the program. </p>
          <p>Pushed out of China, Grant moved to India, where he was named Director of the All India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health in 1939. While there, he also participated in India’s influential Bhore Committee, which surveyed the state of Indian health care and recommended a number of steps that eventually helped to revolutionize the quality of medical care for Indians.</p>
          <p>Grant remained in India until 1945, when he began a three-year survey of international trends in medical care that took him throughout Canada, the U.S., and Europe. In 1948 he was named Director of the IHD’s European office, and three years later he was promoted to Associate Director of the RF’s Division of Medicine and Public Health. During his time in New York, Grant also consulted on a number of outside projects, including President Truman’s Commission on the Health Needs of the Nation in 1951 and a United Nations project to evaluate community development, including health programs, in Southeast Asia between 1952 and 1953.</p>
          <p>Grant retired from the RF in 1956, but he continued post-retirement projects that allowed him to return to Puerto Rico in an effort to coordinate the territory’s health care system and teach preventative medicine at the University of Puerto Rico.</p>
          <p>Throughout his career, Grant’s expertise was recognized with numerous awards and citations. In 1960 Grant received the prestigious Lasker Award from the American Public Health Association. This award recognized his forty-year commitment to the improvement of public health. He also received a number of awards from foreign governments that testified to his widespread work to improve global health systems.</p>
          <p>John B. Grant died in Puerto Rico in 1962 following a heart attack. At the time of his death he was still actively engaged in improving the field of public health.</p>

          <p>Roger Greene was born in Westborough, Massachusetts, in 1881, while his missionary parents were on furlough in United States. Daniel and Mary Jane Greene had devoted their adult lives to bringing Western-style education to Japan. As a result of their work, Roger Greene and his seven siblings were brought up in Japan and developed strong ties to the Far East.</p>
          <p>Greene returned to Massachusetts to pursue his education at Harvard University. After receiving a graduate degree in 1902, Greene joined the U.S. Consular Service and worked for twelve years in a variety of locations that included Brazil, Japan and China. In 1914 Green left to join the Rockefeller Foundation (RF), where his brother Jerome Greene served as Secretary.</p>
          <p>Greene’s first position with the RF was with the 1914 China Commission. This commission, which also included Harry Pratt Judson of the University of Chicago and Dr. Francis Peabody of Harvard Medical School, surveyed the medical and public health needs of China and determined the blueprint for future RF activities in the country. As a result of the China Commission’s survey, the RF created the China Medical Board (CMB), which was instrumental in modernizing Chinese medical education. Based on his work with the Commission, and his own knowledge of Chinese language and culture, Greene was named Resident Director of the CMB in China in 1914, Director of the CMB in 1921, and Acting Director of Peking Union Medical College (PUMC) and Vice President of the RF in the Far East in 1927.</p>
          <p>While his work in China had garnered him accolades and promotions within the Foundation, his relationship with the organization soured over changes in its policies toward China. Greene also advocated against the imposition of Western Christianity in Chinese medical education, arguing that the Department of Religion at PUMC was expendable as the Foundation faced budget cuts during the Great Depression. Finding little support for these ideas among his American colleagues, Greene resigned from the CMB in 1934 and from PUMC in 1935.</p>
          <p>Following his resignation from the RF, Greene maintained his interest in China. He lobbied for American aid to the country following its invasion by Japan, and during World War II he served as a consultant to the State Department’s Division of Cultural Relations. He also promoted the study of East Asian languages and cultures in America.</p>
          <p>Roger Greene died in 1947 in West Palm Beach, Florida and is buried in Westborough, Massachusetts.</p>

          <p>Alan Gregg served as an instrumental figure in the Rockefeller Foundation (RF), directing support for medical research and medical education throughout the 1930s and 1940s and rising to the office of the Vice President in 1951.</p>
          <p>Born in 1890 in Colorado Springs, Colorado, Gregg headed East to earn both an undergraduate (1911) and a medical degree (1916) from Harvard University. Following medical school, Gregg volunteered his services on the Western front in World War I, joining up with Great Britain’s Royal Army Medical Corps in 1917 and remaining until his discharge in 1919.</p>
          <p>After the war Gregg began his career with the RF. In 1919 Gregg joined the International Health Division (IHD) and was immediately assigned to the field staff in Brazil. Gregg remained in Brazil until 1922, when he accepted the position of Associate Director of the RF’s Division of Medical Education.  In 1929 Gregg became the Associate Director of the Medical Sciences Division and one year later was promoted to director. Gregg left this position in 1951 and assumed the office of Vice President of the RF, a title he held until his retirement in 1956. </p>
          <p>In his work with the Medical Sciences Division, Gregg took a special interest in helping to build the field of psychiatry. Gregg firmly believed that the teaching of psychiatry and the funding of mental health research should be on par with the attention given any other disease of the body. Gregg supported initiatives that ensured the inclusion of psychiatry in standard medical school curricula and also directed RF funding toward individual researchers in the field.</p>
          <p>In addition to his work with the RF, Gregg served as an advisor to a number of government departments, including the Office of the Surgeon General of the War Department, the National Institute of Mental Health, and the psychiatric and neuropsychiatric sections of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Gregg also received the French National Order of the Legion of Honour and was named as an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Medicine in Great Britain. In 1956, he received an award from the Lasker Foundation in 1956 that recognized his service in the fields of public health, medical education and research.</p>
          <p>Alan Gregg passed away in Big Sur, California in 1957.</p>

          <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
          <p>Born in London, England, in 1883, Selskar Gunn led a distinguished career with the Rockefeller Foundation (RF) that involved him in some of the most important issues of his day. </p>
          <p>Gunn arrived in the U.S. in 1900 to attend the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He graduated with a B.S. in 1905, became an American citizen in 1906 and subsequently held a number of positions in the field of public health before becoming an officer of the RF.</p>
          <p>Gunn’s twenty-five year career with the RF included a number of important appointments. In 1917 he was sent to France to act as Associate Director of the Commission for Prevention of Tuberculosis in France. He took a lead role in the public education portion of the program and in training French medical staff. He remained in this position until 1920, when he headed to Czechoslovakia to serve as an advisor to that nation’s Public Health Administration. In 1922 the RF reassigned Gunn to the Paris office of the RF to assume the directorship of divisional operations for all of Europe. Gunn remained a member of the International Health Division (IHD) until 1927. </p>
          <p>In that year Gunn was jointly appointed Vice President of European Operations and Assistant Director of Social Science Programs in Europe.  His success in both these positions resulted in his election to Vice President of the RF in 1932. </p>
          <p>Gunn’s career with the RF was transformed after a trip to China in 1931. In China he saw an opportunity for the RF to apply both its money and its workforce to a major, multidisciplinary project involving agriculture, education and health care, and he persistently lobbied the organization to achieve this goal. </p>
          <p>Gunn’s research in China on subsequent trips resulted in China and the Rockefeller Foundation,  a 1934 report to RF trustees that would go on to form the basis of RF grants to The China Program officially launched in 1935. As developed by Gunn, the China Program paired RF officers with Chinese institutions in order to tackle the problems of China’s rural poor. Foundation funding focused specifically on training native talent to develop a corps of professionals to focus on problems in sanitation, agriculture and medicine. Unfortunately, the China Program came to an end by the late 1930s after the Japanese invasion.</p>
          <p>By 1938 Gunn had returned to RF’s Paris office to resume work in Europe, but the Nazi invasion of France forced him to leave for New York in 1940. He died in 1944 after a long- term illness.</p>
          <p>More information on the career of Selskar Gunn can be found in RF Annual Reports from 1917 to 1942.</p>

            <p>This diary is a report of Selskar Gunn's interviews and correspondence with various members of the RF IHB program, medical officers seeking fellowships from the IHB, and reports on Public Health Progress in Europe in the post-war period. While the first part of Gunn's diary records his activities and meetings while based in the Paris office of the RF, the later half of the diary records his tour of Eastern Europe, specifically Prague, Belgrade, Budapest, Sofia, and Bucharest. In each of these nations, Gunn and his associates met with the chief medical officers of the local Public Health and Hygiene Institutes as well as having audiences with members of the royal families of these countries to discuss combined RF and governmental investments in Public Health and Medical Education improvements.</p>

            <p>This diary is a record of Mr. Gunn's interviews and travels between October 21, 1932 and September 11, 1933. This first part of Gunn's diary is devoted to his time in Hawaii interviewing the professors, doctors, and administrators of the University of Hawaii and various public health institutes. While Gunn's diary states he sailed for Yokohama Japan on Oct. 28th, the next entry on Nov. 28th places him in present-day Beijing at Yenching University. The rest of the diary records Gunn's travels to the major cities in China, inspecting the universities receiving funding from the RF and recording the state of Chinese education. Two particularly long entries record the poor quality of academic discipline in the Chinese university and the current and growing state of the hostilities between KMT and Communist forces in Fukien province.</p>

          <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
          <p>Lewis Wendell Hackett’s career with the Rockefeller Foundation (RF) spanned thirty-five years and seventeen countries.</p>
          <p>Born in California in 1884, Hackett was an academically gifted student who earned a B.A. and an M.D. from Harvard University in 1905 and 1912, as well as Harvard’s first Ph.D. in Public Health in 1914. Soon after graduation he began his career with the RF, a career distinguished by his important leadership and contributions in the fields of malaria, hookworm and public health.</p>
          <p>Hackett’s first position with the RF brought him to Panama, where as Field Director for the International Health Division (IHD) he conducted hookworm control demonstrations across Central America. In 1916 he moved to RF offices in Brazil, where he once again directed activities and conducted demonstrations in hookworm and malaria, control, as well as in the practice of rural sanitation. While in Brazil, he helped to establish a nursing school and contributed significantly to the development of public health nursing in that country. </p>
          <p>In 1924 Hackett was reassigned to Italy, where he led a malaria survey. He effectively organized public health demonstrations in malaria control across Italy, but by 1928 he was developing a deeper interest in the biology of malaria-carrying mosquitoes. Along with IHD staff, he directed field labs in Italy, Greece, Spain and Bulgaria, and the work of these labs was instrumental in identifying several species of malaria-carrying mosquitoes, a discovery that would affect populations suffering from malaria across the world.</p>
          <p>Hackett continued to work with the IHD in the field of malaria control and began malaria eradication efforts in Egypt, but work in North Africa had to be abandoned due to the encroaching war. In 1940 he returned to South America, where he directed RF offices and helped to institute public health measures in Chile, Bolivia, Peru and Ecuador.  In 1945 he was named Associate Director of the IHD.</p>

            <p>Organized according to visit and interview, entries for this year record the meetings and conversations that took place between Hanson, professionals and students in the field of natural sciences. Entries record his tours of various laboratories, discussions of research and impressions of fellowship applicants. He tours various universities in the United States to survey their current research for the RF program in experimental biology. The present program of the division of natural sciences of the RF aims to assist in the understanding of behavior. Hanson attends the Meeting of the Mexican Agricultural Commission, and the Meeting of the Chesapeake Bay Fisheries Committee. The diary also includes notes "Possible Lines of Approach to an Evaluation of the Present Status and Future Possibilities of Agriculture in Mexico."</p>

          <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
          <p>Born in Painesville, Ohio, in 1906, George Harrar spent most of his childhood in nearby Youngstown. He entered Oberlin College at age 16, where he distinguished himself not only as a student but also as a track star. Upon graduating in 1928, Harrar considered entering medical school, but the Depression rendered such an education too expensive. Instead, he supported himself as a teaching fellow at Iowa State University while he earned his M.S. in biology, specializing in plant pathology. In 1929 he embarked on a four-year term as a professor and head of the biology department at the University of Puerto Rico, an experience he later credited with sparking his interest in Latin American language and culture.</p>
          <p>Harrar returned to graduate school in 1934 as a Firestone Fellow at the University of Minnesota, where he researched diseases in rubber plants for Firestone’s Liberian plant. After completing his Ph.D. in 1935, Harrar taught biology at Virginia Polytechnic Institute until 1941 and then moved to Washington State College in 1942, where he chaired the department of plant pathology and headed the division of plant pathology at the college’s Agricultural Experiment Station.</p>
          <p>In 1943 the Rockefeller Foundation (RF) asked Harrar to become local director of its new Mexican Agricultural Program. Harrar proved especially well-suited to the institutional culture of the Foundation, and devoted the rest of his career to it, serving as Deputy Director for Agriculture (1951), Director of Agriculture (1955), Vice President of the Foundation (1959), and, beginning in 1961, as trustee and President, positions he held until his 1972 retirement.</p>
          <p>Harrar’s signal qualities, evidenced throughout his tenure at the Foundation, were diplomacy, persistence, and an eye for talent. In Mexico he was renowned for his rapport with government officials, for including officers’ wives in the Foundation’s information loop, and for appointing high-quality staff, many of whom continued with the Foundation for years. A strong-willed administrator, Harrar was instrumental to the successful development and dissemination of high-yield wheat, a technique that would spread worldwide, encompass other grains, and eventually becoming an important element in the “Green Revolution.” He oversaw the transfer of this concept to Asia when he spurred the Foundation to co-found the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines with the Ford Foundation and USAID. He also guided the Foundation’s expansions into Indian and African agriculture.</p>
          <p>Assuming the presidency of the Foundation two years before its 50th anniversary gave Harrar the opportunity to update programs and purposes. He spearheaded the Foundation’s 1963 reorganization, the first major reorganization since 1928. His five-point plan crossed disciplinary boundaries in pursuit of overarching thematic goals. For example, the social, agricultural, natural, and medical sciences now worked together on a program entitled “Toward the Conquest of Hunger.”</p>
          <p>Harrar led the Foundation through some of its most generous years, as the flourishing economy of the 1960s enabled the value of assets to soar and the rate of giving to rise. Yet he also presided during the upheaval wrought by the Tax Reform Act of 1969. Heated debates over this proposed legislation compelled Harrar to serve as an outspoken defender of philanthropic foundations in general, and of the Rockefeller Foundation’s own ethics and transparency.</p>
          <p>From 1973 to 1979, Harrar chaired the Governing Council of the Rockefeller Archive Center (RAC). He was a member of countless committees, boards, and organizations, including the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Philosophical Society and the Near East Foundation. He served on President Lyndon B. Johnson’s General Advisory Committee on Foreign Assistance Programs, the Committee on U.S.-Latin American Relations, and was part of the 1973 Scientific Delegation to the People’s Republic of China. He received innumerable awards from nations in which he had worked and more than a dozen honorary degrees.</p>
          <p>George Harrar died unexpectedly of a heart attack at his home in Scarsdale, New York, in 1982.</p>

          <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
          <p>John H. Janney was born in Brookville, Maryland on July 24, 1893. He was the child of Quaker farmers. When he matured Janney attended the Earlham College, a Quaker college in Richmond, Indiana. He graduated in 1913 with a B.S degree and was determined to go to medical school.  Ultimately Janney decided to attend John Hopkins Medical School. After he graduated in 1917 he completed a six-month internship and then promptly joined the Army Medical Corp.  In the Army Jenny served in London where he treated British Soldiers who had been injured in World War I. He later served in France working on a field Ambulance and as Battalion Medical Officer. During the conflict he was injured by a gas attack and had to spend a great deal of time recuperating. He returned to duty to serve in a convalescent ward for American Officers, where he served until the end of the war. 
	
Following the end of the war Janney stayed in England, where he attended a three month medical refresher course at the University of Edinburgh. Either while attending the course or as result of his hospital stay after the gas attack he meet a nurse named Brenda Hopkins, who he ended up marrying.  The couple would end up having two children. When Janney was reading the Journal of the American Medical Association one day he noticed an ad for the Association for the Adoption of the Metric System that reproduced a letter from General Gorgas which had a Rockefeller Foundation letterhead. Seeking a job, Janney wrote to the address listed in the ad and was appointed the Foundation’s International Health Board (IHB).  Initially he was assigned to learn about rural health work by serving as a County Health Officer in Beaufort County, North Carolina. In 1921 the IHB member who was slated to do public heath work in Brazil failed his physical examination and so Jenney was sent in his place. He spent six years working in public health in Brazil, initially in Sao Paulo and later in Minas Gerais.  Janney also fought to eradicate Hookworm in the country.  When he returned to the United State Janney attended John Hopkins to receive his Masters in Public Health. He received the degree in 1928. Shortly following the receipt of his degree Janney again worked for the IHB in doing rural health work in the United States. Among several accomplishments he established a model health department in Anne Arduel County, Maryland which worked with the John Hopkins School of Public Health. </p>
          <p>Following his time in Maryland the IHB sent Janney to Romania where he did epidemiological work streptococcus among rural populations. He identified several streoticocci bacteria associated with Scarlet Fever. He spent seven months in New York City analyzing this data, the only time Janney would be in New York while working for the Rockefeller Foundation or the IHB.   In 1940 Janney was sent by the IHB to Europe to supervise public health, malaria and nursing operations in Portugal and nutrition and nursing in Spain. He was responsible for arrange the importation of $5 million dollars of Red Cross food relief to into Spain in the wake of the Civil War.
	
The most high profile part of Janney’s career was in Chile where he served as a public health advisor. Initially, he took on the responsibility of assisting in the establishment of a school of public health and worked to create a health unit in the Santiago Suburbs. The public health school that Janney worked to help create began to train its first students for M.P.H degrees in 1944.  Janney also assisted in establishing a rural health center in San Felipe. Janney’s wife, Brenda Janney worked to train farm workers at the facility because agricultural improvement was seen as a key way of improving nutrition and thereby public health.  In 1955 Janney returned to Chile to work with the University of Chile and the Catholic University of Chile to help effectively use the grant money that the Rockefeller Foundation had given them. The Rockefeller Foundation viewed Janney as more reliable then the Chilean’s themselves in judging how to spend grant money.   The Rockefeller Foundation’s Committee of Trustees went as far as to suggest that Janney was “irreplaceable” and that when the history of Chilean Medicine was examined in the future it would be “divided in the pre-Janney, Janney and post-Janney periods.”   </p>
          <p>For his service Janney received a number of prestigious awards. He was made an honorary member of the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Chile in 1946. In 1951 he received a prestigious commission as a Comendador and later Gran Oficial in the Rioja de O’Higgins Order of Merit from the Chilean government.  He left Chile in 1959 and retired to Clarksville, Maryland.  Janney suggested that his retirement had three components “Eating and drinking, which is the most dangerous; reminiscing, which is the most boring; and criticizing, which is the most futile.”  John Janney died on November 19, 1975 in Cantonville, Maryland.

          <p>Norman Lloyd was the Rockefeller Foundation's (RF) Director of Arts from 1965 to 1969, and Director for Arts and Humanities from 1970 to 1972. A self-described "artistic gadfly," Lloyd had a prestigious and varied career as a pianist, composer, conductor, teacher, and author.</p>
          <p>Norman Lloyd was born on November 8, 1909 in Pottsville, Pennsylvania. He received B.S. and M.S. degrees in music education with a specialization in teaching music theory from New York University.</p>
          <p>Lloyd taught at the New York University School of Education and Sarah Lawrence College from 1936 to 1946. He served as Director of Education at the Juilliard School of Music from 1946 to 1949, and then continued on as faculty at the school. In 1963, Lloyd left Juilliard to serve as Dean of the Conservatory of Music at Oberlin College. The same year, his influential method for teaching music theory was recognized with a Doctorate of Music from the Philadelphia Conservatory of Music. His acclaimed curriculum, "Literature and Materials of Music," was celebrated for its engaging, discussion-based approach that brought composers into the classroom to meet with students.</p>
          <p>The Cold War climate of the 1950s and 1960s prompted the Rockefeller Foundation to devote increasing resources to supporting and promoting American cultural programs. In September 1964 the RF established a new Arts Division separate from the Humanities, and Norman Lloyd was appointed to serve as the Division's Director in 1965. Lloyd was primarily responsible for cultural development in the United States; under his direction the Division supported playwrights, composers (including a separate grant for African American composers), symphony orchestras, music conservatories, and college theaters. When the RF merged the two programs again in 1970, Lloyd became Director for Arts and Humanities. He held this position until his retirement in December 1972.</p>
          <p>In addition to teaching and working for the RF, Lloyd composed and conducted dance scores and music for more than thirty documentary and experimental films. He also wrote articles about music and music education for publications including the Juilliard Review, Dance Observer, and Film Music, and authored and edited a number of works including The Fireside Book of Favorite American Songs, The Fireside book of Folk Songs, The Golden Encyclopedia of Music, and Fundamentals of Sight Singing and Ear Training (co-authored with Arnold Fish).</p>
          <p>Norman Lloyd died of leukemia in 1980 at the age of 70.</p>
