      <p>Rockefeller Foundation diaries:</p>
      <p>Officers of the Rockefeller Foundation in New York and its staff members in the field often visited educational, scientific and research institutions and laboratories in many parts of the world to maintain contacts and assess work being done. Officers and field staff frequently conferred with government officials regarding the operation of the RF's programs. In order to preserve accurate records for the guidance of other RF officers, those who carried on these activities kept diaries of their day-to-day contacts and impressions. These diaries were sent to the RF office, where they circulated among officers and staff to the extent deemed advisable.</p>
      <p>Rockefeller Foundation:</p>
      <p>The Rockefeller Foundation was established by act of the New York State Legislature approved by the Governor on May 14, 1913, "to promote the well-being of mankind throughout the world." Between 1913 and 1928 the China Medical Board, the International Health Board, and the Division of Medical Education functioned as divisions of the Foundation, concentrating on the administration of programs in public health and medical education. A Division of Studies was created in 1923 to handle projects outside the medical field. These early years were experimental as the new foundation studied the methods of philanthropy and explored its relationships with other Rockefeller boards.</p>
      <p>Although the Rockefeller Foundation is the largest and best known philanthropy founded by the Rockefeller family, it was neither the first nor the last to be established. The Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research (1901), the General Education Board (1902), the Rockefeller Sanitary Commission for the Eradication of Hookworm Disease (1909), and the Bureau of Social Hygiene (1911) all existed earlier. When the Foundation was created, the Sanitary Commission was disbanded. After the establishment of the Foundation, the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial (1918) and the International Education Board (1923) were created.</p>
      <p>The Rockefeller boards and their programs were reconsidered and reorganized in 1927-1928 in order to avoid overlapping programs. The International Health Board of the Foundation was disbanded and an International Health Division was organized. The China Medical Board, Inc., was established as a separately incorporated institution, and the China Medical Board of the Foundation ceased to exist. The Division of Studies was dropped and the Division of Medical Education was phased out. The Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial was combined with the Foundation and the Spelman Fund of New York was chartered to continue activities of the LSRM that were not absorbed by the Foundation. The International Education Board was disbanded.</p>
      <p>As a result of this reorganization, the Foundation adopted a program which included public health work (administered by the IHD), the advancement of knowledge in the medical and natural sciences (in part taken over from the IEB), the social sciences (formerly the field of the LSRM), and the humanities and arts (shared with the GEB). The Rockefeller Institute and the Bureau of Social Hygiene were not affected by the reorganization. The program adopted by the Foundation at this time remained basically the same for the next twenty years.</p>
      <p>As its files accumulated, the Foundation maintained a card index recording the names of institutional and individual grantees and correspondents. A microfilm copy of this index is available at the Archive Center.</p>

      <p>Rockefeller Foundation officers' diaries:</p>
      <p>Diaries are of two types: regular daily diaries, and special trip diaries. Some diaries have indexes, which are bound in the annual volume; indexing was not a requirement but was left to the discretion of the officers, and not all diaries are indexed.</p>
      <p>Diaries frequently contain information given in confidence, and were thus treated as confidential., The period covered is approximately 1911-1992.</p>

            <p>This diary is both a travelogue and report of Dr. Ferrell’s 1915 trip to British Honduras (Belize), Guatemala, and Salvador (El Salvador) on behalf of the International Health Board, providing his observations of the state of public health, economic life, and culture in the three Central American nations. In the diary, Dr. Ferrell inspects the clinical and public health facilities available to the native populations and reports that the government officials in each nation are eager for support from the IHB in establishing public health campaigns to eradicate Hookworm Disease, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. He also provides his endorsement for several native medical professionals who he believes would be indispensable to the IHB’s work in establishing native medical institutions and who would be deserving of IHB scholarships. Where statistical information is available, Dr. Ferrell collects figures on rates of infection and morbidity resulting from Hookworm disease, mostly from plantations in Guatemala and Salvador where the data is collected by corporate owners, the largest being the United Fruit Company, whose facilities in Guatemala are extensively reported on. Dr. Ferrell also reports on his time in Guatemala and Salvador as the guest and colleague of Dr. Walter H. Rowan, Director of the Guatemalan branch of the International Health Board, who helps him to secure an agreement with the Consejo Superior de Salubridad (National Department of Health) for the immediate establishment of an IHB public health campaign in the Republic of Salvador.</p>

            <p>This diary provides Dr. Ferrell’s observations on the state of public health affairs in Mexico on the federal, state, and local level. Visiting Mexico City, Jalapa, and Tierra Blanca, he is given a tour by Dr. Henry P. Carr, who is in charge of the RF’s Mexican operations, and Dr. Jose Zozaya, Director of the Institute of Hygiene, of the recently built federal, state, and local public health facilities. Ferrell’s summary of the tour suggests that these facilities are extravagantly built, taxing on Mexico’s strained economy and government budgets, and highlight the lack of cooperation between federal, state, and local authorities. This concern is expressed in Dr. Ferrell’s final recommendations, where he also praises the work of Dr. Carr, which has led to a “sanitary triumph” in Mexico, and suggests shifting operational focus from Hookworm Disease to Malaria containment.</p>

            <p>This diary records Raymond Fosdick's correspondence and meetings with several influential and important Rockefeller Foundation Officers as well as several brief encounters with Nelson Rockefeller and John D. Rockefeller, Jr. The diary covers three subjects: the General Education Board, the Paris Office of the RF, and the Scientific Division of the RF. For the most part the journal describes the negotiations involved in disbursing RF funds for the General Education Board to colleges and universities and its endeavors in the African-American community in the American South. Fosdick also devotes a significant amount of time describing the opinions between American and British scientists and RF officers on how best to structure the Foundation's activities in Medical and Natural Sciences. Fosdick consults several experts on America's standing among the global scientific community in the fields of organic chemistry, biology, and physics. Furthermore, Fosdick consults with his fellow officers on the most efficient structure and governance of the Paris Office, which leads to a discussion on how the RF should interact with politically unfree nations such as Germany and Japan and how it should continue to conduct its work in those nations.</p>

As the diary covers the pre- and post-WW II period, there is significant discussion on the appropriate actions for the Foundation to take in the continuation of its activities during the war and after in China and Eastern Europe in the early stages of the Cold War. Fosdick also highlights the Foundation's significant contributions to atomic research through Ernest Lawrence and Warren Weaver and his belief that the atomic age would continue to shape the Foundation's work in each of its other departments. This diary also reveals Fosdick's desires to reorganize the Foundation's efforts in all its programs to have greater impact and relevance, especially in the areas of the General Education Board and the Division of Medical Science.</p>

            <p>This diary is a report of Selskar Gunn's interviews and correspondence with various members of the RF IHB program, medical officers seeking fellowships from the IHB, and reports on Public Health Progress in Europe in the post-war period. While the first part of Gunn's diary records his activities and meetings while based in the Paris office of the RF, the later half of the diary records his tour of Eastern Europe, specifically Prague, Belgrade, Budapest, Sofia, and Bucharest. In each of these nations, Gunn and his associates met with the chief medical officers of the local Public Health and Hygiene Institutes as well as having audiences with members of the royal families of these countries to discuss combined RF and governmental investments in Public Health and Medical Education improvements.</p>

            <p>This diary is a record of Mr. Gunn's interviews and travels between October 21, 1932 and September 11, 1933. This first part of Gunn's diary is devoted to his time in Hawaii interviewing the professors, doctors, and administrators of the University of Hawaii and various public health institutes. While Gunn's diary states he sailed for Yokohama Japan on Oct. 28th, the next entry on Nov. 28th places him in present-day Beijing at Yenching University. The rest of the diary records Gunn's travels to the major cities in China, inspecting the universities receiving funding from the RF and recording the state of Chinese education. Two particularly long entries record the poor quality of academic discipline in the Chinese university and the current and growing state of the hostilities between KMT and Communist forces in Fukien province.</p>

            <p>Organized according to visit and interview, entries for this year record the meetings and conversations that took place between Hanson, professionals and students in the field of natural sciences. Entries record his tours of various laboratories, discussions of research and impressions of fellowship applicants. He tours various universities in the United States to survey their current research for the RF program in experimental biology. The present program of the division of natural sciences of the RF aims to assist in the understanding of behavior. The focus on experimental biology has narrowed to focus on the avenue of nutrition. Hanson attends a meeting of the Chesapeake Bay Fisheries Commission and visits Woods Hole marine biology laboratory.</p>
