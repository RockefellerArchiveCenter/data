The initial 1,064 reels are formatted on 35mm microfilm, while the remaining 8,217 reels are 16mm microfilm. Each reel of microfilm is identified by a unique box number beginning with the letter "R"; for instance R-0001, R-002, etc. However, the Grant Files were not microfilmed in numerical order. To identify which reel of microfilm a Grant File is housed on, please see the 'Reel #' field in the LINKS database.</physdesc>

<p>Each Ford Foundation Grant and the corresponding Grant File is identified by a unique Program Action (PA) number. PA numbers begin with the year a grant was made (2-digits), followed by a sequential number within that year (4-digits).</p><p>For example: PA 55-0123 was the 123rd grant made in the year 1955. PA numbers are often typed or handwritten on Ford documents in the following format:  55-123  (year)-(####).  However, the Ford Foundation's grants database (LINKS) uses an 8-digit format for PA numbers:  05500123 (0YY#####).</p><p>Beginning in the 1970s the 4th digit in the 8-digit PA number was used to encode at least three different types of Ford grants:  </p><p>0YY5####    = Unknown Code. 
0YY6####    = Grants to Individuals (see Chp. 1.1)
0YY9####    = Foundation-Administered-Projects (FAPs) (see Chp. 1.2)</p><p>After the year 2000 a "1" is used as the first digit in the 8-digit PA number to signify the 21st century.

Also, early Grant Files (roughly 1950-1970) often include a CROSS REFERENCE sheet listing other grants made in a related subject or Program Area, and a 'BIBLIOGRAPHY of GRANT-RELATED MATERIALS' at the beginning of the file.</p><p>Each Ford Foundation Grant and the corresponding Grant File is identified by a unique Program Action (PA) number.
