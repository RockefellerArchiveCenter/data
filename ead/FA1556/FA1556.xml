<p>The Asian Cultural Council was established in 1980 following the dissolution of the JDR 3rd Fund. The Council continued the work of the JDR 3rd Fund's Asian Cultural Program (1963-1979), which promoted East-West cultural understanding under the leadership of Datus C. Smith, Jr. and Porter A. McCrary. </p>

<p>The Council was established as a publicly supported operating foundation in 1980, and since 1991 has been formally affiliated with the Rockefeller Brothers Fund. Its major focus has been on providing individual fellowship awards to artists, scholars, students, and specialists from Asia undertaking research, study, travel, and creative work in the U.S. Between 1963 and 2000, the ACC grant program provided grant assistance to more than 3,100 Asian and American individuals in the arts and humanities.</p>
