    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>In the early 1970s, the Ford Foundation's archives staff began to identify and catalog individual reports, policy and programming documents, and program evaluations in an effort to create an internal lending-library of useful documents. Many of the Catalogued Reports were physically culled from the former Foundation officers' and staff's archival collections of 'office files'.  When those collections of 'office files' were later processed, and finding aids created, an appendix of "Reports Removed" (or, Reports Transferred") was added to the finding aids.  </p><p>By 1977 the collection included more than 3,500 reports, and by 1979 some 5,000 reports had been cataloged. </p><p>Duplicated copies of the reports were also created on microfiche, and later microfilm.</p>  </bioghist>
