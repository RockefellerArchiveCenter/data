      <p>Preliminary archival processing of the records was conducted by the Rockefeller Archive Center to establish intellectual and physical control of the material and assess its immediate preservation and conservation needs. The collection remains in storage boxes and original folders. A large majority of the storage boxes were renumbered during preliminary processing. Further archival processing, primarily to arrange the records to facilitate more efficient scholarly access to the collection and address its long-term preservation, will be conducted at a later date, as necessary.</p>

      <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
      <p>The original purposes of the Jackson Hole Preserve were to restore, protect,and preserve primitive grandeur and natural beauty for the benefit of the public; to provide for the protection, feeding, and propagation of wild game; and to maintain the historic and scientific features of picturesque areas.</p>
      <p>Since 1940, when the preserve was founded by John D. Rockefeller, Jr. and his son Laurance, JHPI has given to the United States more than 33,000 acres of land for national parks in the Grand Tetons of Wyoming, the Virgin Islands in the Caribbean, and New York State. In addition, the preserve has built visitor facilities in these areas and contributed several million dollars to their maintenance.</p>
      <p>In 1958, Jackson Hole Preserve established a new organization, the American Conservation Association, to carry on the educational, research, and citizen action activities that the Preserve felt were beyond its own capabilities.</p>
