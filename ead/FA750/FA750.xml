            <p>Produced by Georgia Department of Corrections. The Alternative to Incarceration program of the Georgia Department of Corrections (GDC) is a systematic approach to planned offender management. It provides effective, productive alternatives to prison by means of a continuum of sentencing options incrementally arrayed with increasing degrees of punishment, control, supervision, and offender services.</p>
            <p>GDC's alternative sentencing program has become a model for others throughout the nation. The Georgia program has set the standard, clearly demonstrating that innovative sentencing can be an effective part of the criminal justice system. These options protect  the public, punish the criminal, provide restitution to the victim and the community, and offer enormous savings to the tax payer.</p>
            <p>Funding for this film was provided by a grant from the Ford Foundation in recognition of the selection of the Georgia Department of Corrections as a winner of the Innovations in State and Local Government Award, a program of the Ford Foundation in collaboration with the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.</p>
