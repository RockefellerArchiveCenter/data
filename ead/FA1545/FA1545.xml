<p>The Ford Foundation was chartered by Henry and Edsel Ford in 1936 "to receive and administer funds for scientific, educational and charitable purposes, all for the public welfare", and initially served the Ford family's charitable interests in the Detroit area. Following the deaths of Edsel Ford (1943) and Henry Ford (1947), the Foundation was propelled to the forefront of philanthropy as the largest American foundation in terms of both endowment and yearly expenditures, and with an international scope to its major program areas. During the Foundation's first twenty years its major programs were in international economic development, primary and higher education, educational and public broadcasting, behavioral sciences, civil liberties, urban development, fine arts and the humanities. The Ford Foundation also partnered with the Rockefeller Foundation in supporting agricultural development in South America, Africa, and Southeast Asia. Since the 1970s, the Foundation has also pioneered programs in women's rights, energy policy, micro-financing in under-developed countries, establishing human rights groups, and improving international HIV/AIDS education.</p>  </bioghist>

<p>Throughout her career, June Zeitlin has worked as a foundation executive, women's rights lawyer, and public policy expert. She held a number of different positions related to human rights, women's rights, public policy, and governance from 1986 to 1999 at the Ford Foundation. The Foundation originally hired her as a Program Officer in the Human Rights and Governance Program. Following a change to the Foundation's program structure for human rights support, she became Deputy Director for the Rights and Social Justice Program. In this position, she was responsible for managing grants for women's rights and opportunities. Then in 1993, she became Director of the Governance and Public Policy Program and retained her Director responsibilities when that program transitioned to become Governance and Civil Society.</p><p>
Zeitlin graduated from the University of Rochester in 1970 with a B.A. in political science. She then earned her law degree from New York University in 1973. Prior to her work at the Ford Foundation, she held a variety of government and legal advocacy jobs in Washington D.C. and New York City. Some of these jobs included Legislative Assistant to Representative Bella Abzurg (1975-1977), Director of the Office on Domestic Violence in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (1979-1981), Attorney for the National Women's Law Center (1981-1982), and Director of the Office of Legislative Coordination for the New York City Human Resources Administration (1982-1985) among others.</p><p>
After leaving the Ford Foundation in 1999, Zeitlin became Executive Director of the Women's Environment and Development Organization (WEDO). She stayed in that position until 2008 and later served as Director for the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) Education Project at The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.</p>  </bioghist>

Zeitlin primarily addressed her correspondence to grantees, prospective grantees, Ford Foundation staff members, and collaborating institutions and individuals. It documents the various areas of women's rights and opportunities that the Foundation sought to support. These areas include women's legal rights, reproductive rights, women's economic opportunities, the intersection of work and family, the intersection of international human rights and women's rights, and domestic violence prevention. Significant amounts of material regard the Work/Family Collaborative Research Project and the seminars of the Women's Program Forum. The series also contains correspondence that discusses Rights and Social Justice program administration activities such as program review meetings.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ee4a7151a95b2b1c2b412a36d65757fd" level="file"><did><unittitle>Chronological file</unittitle><unitdate normal="1990/1990">1990</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="aspace_7a26838a47810e4bf0e41df6a4d77a45" label="Mixed Materials [A0000000115661]" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_d5ef7280497428f1288d62115fc85493" parent="aspace_7a26838a47810e4bf0e41df6a4d77a45" type="folder">1-4</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ec8bdf6018413a901eb23a69907fcd47" level="file"><did><unittitle>Chronological file, A-L</unittitle><unitdate normal="1991/1991">1991</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="aspace_0706aaa827bb5db8a2b2e4d7308435dc" label="Mixed Materials [A0000000115661]" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_51391638122f32d4ae02087c09cba41b" parent="aspace_0706aaa827bb5db8a2b2e4d7308435dc" type="folder">5-6</container></did></c><c id="aspace_fbeedf7e681a4ec05e11bbdab26f6220" level="file"><did><unittitle>Chronological file, M-Z</unittitle><unitdate normal="1991/1991">1991</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="aspace_7d8601db56e495d93a8b30299e796050" label="Mixed Materials [A0000000115662]" type="box">2</container><container id="aspace_1d9eca5a4684a2516b8af6fa1dca7687" parent="aspace_7d8601db56e495d93a8b30299e796050" type="folder">7-8</container></did></c><c id="aspace_d9c8143969b4ef256d7a739d745ca13f" level="file"><did><unittitle>Chronological file, A-L</unittitle><unitdate normal="1992/1992">1992</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="aspace_20647384f092c7692c0facfe52ff1f27" label="Mixed Materials [A0000000115662]" type="box">2</container><container id="aspace_730d8c0dd4c24871827b7b2e5a43d3d2" parent="aspace_20647384f092c7692c0facfe52ff1f27" type="folder">9-11</container></did></c><c id="aspace_210fc55659b0ebc78c716ce71b1e45e9" level="file"><did><unittitle>Chronological file, M-Z</unittitle><unitdate normal="1992/1992">1992</unitdate><container altrender="Half Letter Document Box" id="aspace_be8b51724276eb8f3a425925a0f83f58" label="Mixed Materials [A0000000115663]" type="box">3</container><container id="aspace_e3b78ad01e0292e36310208d419b212a" parent="aspace_be8b51724276eb8f3a425925a0f83f58" type="folder">12-13</container></did></c></c></dsc>
