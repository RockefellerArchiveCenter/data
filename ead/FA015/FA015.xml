    <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
<p>The Russell Sage Foundation was established in 1907 by Margaret Olivia Slocum Sage (1828-1918) as a memorial to her late husband, Russell Sage, the railroad magnate and Wall Street financier. Mrs. Sage's original gift for the Foundation of $10 million was increased in 1918 with a bequest of $5 million.</p><p>The mission of the Russell Sage Foundation is the "improvement of social and living conditions in the United States of America." Mrs. Sage placed no restrictions on how this mission was to be fulfilled. She wished the scope of the Russell Sage Foundation to be national, but also requested that special attention be paid to New York City and its environs.</p><p>The Russell Sage Foundation received the largest single gift made by Mrs. Sage but she dispensed a total of $35 million between 1907 and her death in 1918. She made most of her contributions in the traditional manner of responding to individual solicitations on a case-by-case basis. Some institutions received a single large gift while others received, for several years, regular gifts of lesser amounts. Mrs. Sage also expressed her support of many organizations, mostly local, in a more symbolic way through gifts of $100 or less, lifetime memberships, or annual patronages.</p><p>Between 1907 and 1946, the Russell Sage Foundation focused its attention on improving the quality of living by exposing social problems and proposing and sponsoring practical solutions for those problems. The results of its investigations and field studies were presented in books, pamphlets and articles published by the Russell Sage Foundation.</p><p>During this time the Foundation was organized by departments based on fields of research. Included among these departments were Charity Organization, Industrial Studies, Recreation, Surveys and Exhibits, and Statistics. The areas of study included, but were not limited to, public welfare, labor and industrial relations, regional planning, penology, child welfare, and the social work profession. The Russell Sage Foundation also supported existing social agencies and helped establish new agencies to serve previously neglected social concerns.</p><p>In 1948, due to declining financial investments and the gradual attrition of its staff, the Russell Sage Foundation underwent a philosophical and structural reorganization. It shifted its focus to basic research in the social and behavioral sciences and the strengthening of social welfare methodology. Structurally, it discontinued its specialized departments and created a coordinated central staff of professional personnel. Much of the work could then be carried out by individuals hired temporarily for specific projects. The Russell Sage Foundation presently continues in this role.</p>  </bioghist>

Series 1 through Series 9 and Series 11 are the records of the Foundation itself. Series 10 is correspondence from Mrs. Sage's private office documenting her personal giving. Because these letters were given to the Foundation after Mrs. Sage's death in 1918, they have been incorporated into the Russell Sage Foundation Records.</p><p>Although many of the Russell Sage Foundation office files from the early years of the Foundation were systematically destroyed in 1949, all of the early departments are documented to some extent in this collection. Especially well documented are the Charity Organizations/Social Work Administration, the Department of Industrial Studies, and the Southern Highland Division. Particular projects also have extensive records. These include the development of Forest Hills Gardens in Queens; the Foundation's efforts toward the passage of a uniform small loan law; and regional planning, both in the New York City region and in general. The administration of the Russell Sage Foundation during the early period is covered by financial records, agenda and minutes from Board of Trustees meetings, and files on the Russell Sage Foundation Building. Nearly all the material dating from the Foundation's inception to the 1948 reorganization can be found in Series 2 - Corporate History and Series 3 - Early Office Files.</p><p>Of the Russell Sage Foundation's later research programs, those with significant documentation include Government, Law and the Social Sciences; Social Sciences and Human Biology; and Studies in Philanthropy. Records of the administration of the Russell Sage Foundation after 1948 can be found mostly in Series 4 - General Administration.</p><p>The bulk of the material in Series 1 through 9 is correspondence. Much of it concerns routine administrative matters, but a significant portion of the correspondence includes personal opinions of the writers, progress reports, and descriptions of day-by-day activities. Also included are meeting agendas and minutes, progress and annual reports, financial statements, newspaper and magazine clippings, pamphlets and brochures. There is little in the way of field notes or working papers for the Foundation's projects and studies. There are also few personal papers for any department head.</p><p>The correspondence from Mrs. Sage's private office, in Series 10, is mostly incoming letters from organizations and individuals soliciting financial support or advice from Mrs. Sage. Some of the petitioners included in Series 10 have extensive documentation, while others are represented by only a letter or two. In many cases the institutional letters recount the history of the individual organizations. In the process of describing their work and explaining their needs, petitioners requesting Mrs. Sage's support created capsule histories of their institutions.</p><p>Mrs. Sage and her secretaries communicated with one another about the requests by writing on the letters' envelopes, sharing opinions, advice, instructions, and summaries of past actions. Although not all the envelopes have been kept, those that provide insight into Mrs. Sage and those that hold details not expressed in the accompanying letters have been kept. In some cases brief information from the envelope has been transcribed onto the letter as a note in brackets. These notes usually provide the amount of money Mrs. Sage contributed or other action taken concerning the request.</p><p>The letters reflect both the topical and geographic diversity of Mrs. Sage's charitable interests. She was particularly supportive of health care, the welfare of men in the armed forces and merchant marines, religious missions, environmental issues, animal welfare, women's education, and suffrage. Although Mrs. Sage's philanthropic support was international in scope, much of her giving was concentrated in the state of New York. Causes and organizations in Syracuse (her birthplace) and New York City received heavy support. Mrs. Sage was also actively concerned with the needs of Sag Harbor and Lawrence, both Long Island summer residences for her and her husband.</p></scopecontent><processinfo id="387fccc3d74ba52942fa315fa417e36d"><head>Processing Information</head><p>Subgroup 1, Series 1-9 were processed by Melissa A.

It is mostly correspondence relating to several of her personal charities. There is also biographical material and a family genealogy. There is very little correspondence from Mrs. Sage herself. Material on Mr. Russell Sage consists mostly of newspaper and magazine articles about his life and career. Although this material was an integral part of the Foundation's office records and thus is separate from Series 10, which came from Mrs. Sage's personal office, there is some overlap between the two series in the correspondence on Mrs. Sage's personal giving.</p></scopecontent><c id="05089373b58a474bb747c1a35a486c8c" level="file"><did><unittitle>General</unittitle><unitdate normal="1907/1982"
