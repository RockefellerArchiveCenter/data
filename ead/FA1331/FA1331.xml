      <p>Between 1955-1964 Douglas Whitaker, Vice President, carried administrative responsibilities which included annual reports required by the University of the State of New York. These reports were primarily financial and reflected the condition of the University. The State Department of Education served to collect data for the Higher Education General Information Survey (HEGIS). As the programs of State aid to non-public institutions of higher education developed reports in many more areas were required. Reports had to be made on housing, coursework, laboratories, degrees conferred, subject distribution of faculty and students, financial aid and library facilities. Reports from many offices of the University on their particular area were required. These reports which first went to the Office of the Vice President were assembled in the Office of Faculty and Student Records and reports were forwarded from there </p>
      <p>The Rockefeller Institute did not become a degree granting institution until 1954 and the first academic year ended in June 1956 which is the date of the first report.</p>

          <p>This registration permitted an exemption from certain reports. This exemption was disallowed in 1956/1957 because of a misunderstanding that it was necessary to refile each year for the exemption.</p>
