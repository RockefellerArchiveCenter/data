Collection consists of more than one accession of Lynn Walker Huntley office files ingested by the RAC over the years. An accession processed in 2018 consisted of a group of subject files regarding the Ford Foundation's work with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and was added to the end of the Subject Files Series in order to reconstitute the relationship between the materials. Another box of Huntley office files was added from a different accession of unrelated Ford Foundation records (Accession 2018:063 of the Ford Foundation records, EMAC, MAC, Office Files of John P. Santos collection) later in 2018. It was determined during the processing of that accession that the materials were connected to the Huntley subject files that the RAC ingested in 2018, and thus the box was incorporated into Huntley's collection.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The Ford Foundation was chartered by Henry and Edsel Ford in 1936 "to receive and administer funds for scientific, educational and charitable purposes, all for the public welfare", and initially served the Ford family's charitable interests in the Detroit area. Following the deaths of Edsel Ford (1943) and Henry Ford (1947), the Foundation was propelled to the forefront of philanthropy as the largest American foundation in terms of both endowment and yearly expenditures, and with an international scope to its major program areas. </p><p>
During the Foundation's first twenty years its major programs were in international economic development, primary and higher education, educational and public broadcasting, behavioral sciences, civil liberties, urban development, fine arts and the humanities. The Ford Foundation also partnered with the Rockefeller Foundation in supporting agricultural development in South America, Africa, and Southeast Asia. Since the 1970s, the Foundation has also pioneered programs in women's rights, energy policy, micro-financing in under-developed countries, establishing human rights groups, and improving international HIV/AIDS education. </p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Lynn Walker Huntley (1945-2015) came to the Ford Foundation in 1982 to work as a Program Officer focusing on civil rights programs. She would eventually become Director of the Rights and Social Justice Program until she left the foundation in 1995. She served briefly as a consultant for Ford after leaving her position as Rights and Social Justice Director and was tasked with monitoring the foundation's grants to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).</p><p>
Prior to her time at Ford, Huntley worked as a lawyer for the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund (LDF) in the 1970s. While with the LDF, she was part of the legal team that managed the Furman v. Georgia legal case. The U.S. Supreme Court's decision on the case in 1972 resulted in a temporary suspension of the death penalty within the whole nation. Huntley would later serve at the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division.</p><p>
During her time at Ford, Huntley helped obtain funding for the U.S. Civil Rights Movement documentary Eyes on the Prize and started the African American Church Initiative. After leaving Ford, she joined the Southern Education Foundation, and in 2002, became president of that foundation.</p>  </bioghist>

It contains a significant number of files concerning the Foundation's support of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). These records originate from a later accession of Huntley's office files that was processed in 2018. They mostly regard the financial, administrative, and legal troubles the NAACP experienced during the early and mid-1990s, the monitoring and disbursement of the Ford Foundation's funding to the organization and its Special Contribution Fund (SCF), the foundation's support for the NAACP's financial and strategic planning initiatives, the controversies surrounding the foundation's backing of the NAACP during this time period, some of the social justice and civil rights issues the NAACP focused on during the 1980s and 1990s, and questions concerning the NAACP's continued relevancy in advocating for racial equality and empowerment of racial minorities amidst its series of crises.</p><p>
Some of the subject files appear to have been created and maintained by Huntley's successor as Director of the Rights and Social Justice Program, Mary E. McClymont, as well as by other staff members of the Human Rights and International Cooperation Unit of the Peace and Social Justice Program which replaced the Rights and Social Justice Program during the foundation's reorganization in 1996. This may indicate that the offices for these programs continued to use and add to the subject files created during Huntley's term as Director of the Rights and Social Justice Program even after Huntley's departure from Ford.</p></scopecontent><c id="0c681c982c654a0389223b8489a99b88" level="file"><did><unittitle>ACLS Comparative Culturalism
