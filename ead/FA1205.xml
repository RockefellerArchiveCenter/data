Rockefeller's political record and achievements as New York State Governor, the tensions and shifts within the Republican Party at the time of the 1964 Presidential Election, Rockefeller's meetings with New York town and county community leaders, and Rockefeller's discontinued run for the Republican Party nomination in the 1964 election. General political records include the correspondence of Program Associate Edgar D. Draper, lists of commitments made by Rockefeller in regards to the activities of various state programs, and transcripts of speeches and interviews by Rockefeller and other individuals. Many of the records discuss the relationship between the Republican Party and the African American community in connection to the Civil Rights Movement and the Republican Party's 1964 presidential candidate, Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater. The subseries includes a transcript of a public statement by Rockefeller in which he discusses the outcome of the election and calls for a constructive rebuilding of the party. Materials related to Rockefeller's various town and county visits throughout the state of New York include memoranda, schedules, lists of key community leaders, and reports providing background information and points of local interest for each meeting location. These documents are loosely organized by the town or county they concern. Records related to Rockefeller's run for Republican Party presidential nominee include correspondence, reports, statements, and pamphlets as well other miscellaneous campaign materials. Several documents originate from the campaigns of other nomination candidates as well as from the larger Republican Party platform. Lastly, the subseries contains a small amount of documents related to John V. Lindsay's campaign for New York City Mayor in 1965.</p></scopecontent><c id="66376d8c078f82f4fd315794e9ae46f6" level="file"><did><unittitle>General political records</unittitle><unitdate normal="1964/1964">1964</unitdate><container altrender="Legal Document Box" id="ae5e443f7b31eb5638c47afe70e2c932" label="mixed materials [A0000000079637]" type="box">1</container><container id="d259739e444da113c3c690bee2cf4730" parent="ae5e443f7b31eb5638c47afe70e2c932" type="folder">1</container></did></c><c id="241fb24921d6fd20720e7c6ad2bdbf31" level="file"><did><unittitle>General political records</unittitle><unitdate normal="1965/1965">1965</unitdate><container altrender="Legal Document Box" id="107814df4beb00b06626c5d45907ce5d" label="mixed materials [A0000000079637]" type="box">1</container><container id="28f9cf3a41479888da752efaf9655a25" parent="107814df4beb00b06626c5d45907ce5d" type="folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aab03c4e194646eecab5343d29d404ce" level="file"><did><unittitle>General political records</unittitle><unitdate normal="1966/1966">1966</unitdate><container altrender="Legal Document Box" id="7357ecbc11b6f6b70d479dcf7706b1eb" label="mixed materials [A0000000079637]" type="box">1</container><container id="0456223057ad9badcf17c5ab090b2bb9" parent="7357ecbc11b6f6b70d479dcf7706b1eb" type="folder">3</container></did></c><c id="4763e1b0981b4cbd28555a4369a4410f" level="file"><did><unittitle>John V.

Rockefeller's Executive Chamber, the New York State Education Department, and other local, state, and national organizations concerned with education policy and institutions. Much of the education reform discussed in the subseries involves expansion of education opportunities to minority and disadvantaged populations, increased medical and health professional training in response to the state's Medicaid program, and improved programs for science and technology learning. Several files concern state and national education policy in a broad sense. These files include correspondence, reports, and other materials related to legislation and performance of state education programs, background information on the proposed Pennsylvania Plan property tax law, and multistate collaboration on education policy through the activities of the Interstate Compact for Education. A large part of the subseries specifically pertains to higher education policy and development with a particular focus on funding for the City University of New York. These materials include transcripts of addresses by various education and city officials before a Joint Legislative Committee on Education on March 22, 1966, CUNY budget information, correspondence concerning Rockefeller's support for the City University Supplementary Aid and Construction Bill, and a number of draft letters Program Associate Edgar D. Draper created when preparing Rockefeller's official responses to calls for greater state aid to CUNY. This subseries also includes tabulations of monetary amounts distributed by the state for college scholarships in the academic years 1958-1959 and 1964-1965.</p></scopecontent><c

Rockefeller's administration in the origins and activities of the Interstate Compact for Education and its governing body, the Education Commission of the States. Much of the content found within the subseries pertains to different planning, interim, and annual meetings of the Compact and Commission. These records primarily consist of conference programs, reports, lists of attendees, meeting minutes, agendas, transcripts of addresses, and promotional materials related to both the actual meetings and the cities that hosted the meetings.  The subseries also contains correspondence, press clippings, and transcripts of public speeches that relate to the Compact in a broader sense. The correspondence compiled by Rockefeller's Program Associate, Edgar D. Draper, chiefly concerns the list of delegates Rockefeller selected to represent the state of New York at different meetings of the Education Commission of the States. Lastly, the subseries contains several copies of the Compact for Education summary, copies of the Compact's Enabling Act, copies of New York State legislative bills related to the state joining the Compact, a copy of the Education Commission of the States Bylaws, and drafts and copies of other resolutions passed by the Compact.</p></scopecontent><c id="9bde42f072bfb0b85422712326b52479" level="file"><did><unittitle>General correspondence</unittitle><unitdate normal="1965/1967" type="inclusive">1965-1967</unitdate><container altrender="Legal Document Box" id="bdee8c9db5185e00314661b7ea88fe01" label="mixed materials [A0000000079643]" type="box">7</container><container id="3e4b59831284629ac170bda7e4e3f025" parent="bdee8c9db5185e00314661b7ea88fe01" type="folder">65-68</container></did></c><c id="6506abb4e86c19bc1e3ca8c9c4c52bd0" level="file"><did><unittitle>Compact for Education Enabling Act and bills for New York State adoption</unittitle><unitdate normal="1965/1967" type="inclusive">1965-1967</unitdate><container altrender="Legal Document Box" id="7422bf7d1ad12569feb9b66083cf0cca" label="mixed materials [A0000000079643]" type="box">7</container><container id="86f55a430467db6749c89f5e415feff8" parent="7422bf7d1ad12569feb9b66083cf0cca" type="folder">69-70</container></did></c><c id="2eed325010ee821e15dffb6272187ea1" level="file"><did><unittitle>Education Commission of the States Bylaws and other Compact for Education resolutions</unittitle><unitdate normal="1965/1965">1965</unitdate><container altrender="Legal Document Box" id="fd10c4942f637f053645876b2e4f98f3" label="mixed materials [A0000000079643]" type="box">7</container><container id="a2797d204f58de51c537f84bf7f268df" parent="fd10c4942f637f053645876b2e4f98f3" type="folder">71</container></did></c><c id="1c345e92f28b8364b2b9683850eadfee" level="file"><did><unittitle>Education Commission of the States publications and reports</unittitle><unitdate normal="1966/1967" type="inclusive">1966-1967</unitdate><container altrender="Legal Document Box" id="6317bb3a81decb5247d288987bdabbe8" label="mixed materials [A0000000079643]" type="box">7</container><container id="f70bb69099bed608feed8349156753b9" parent="6317bb3a81decb5247d288987bdabbe8" type="folder">72-73</container></did><scopecontent id="f0da849cda93a64d05abb9fab4f79393"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This file contains three publications printed by the Education Commission of the States: </p><p>1) "Power Play for Control of Education" - a copy of the edited proceedings of the Commission's 1967 Annual Meeting; 2) Vol.1 No.7 of "Compact" - a monthly journal publication by the Commission; 3) "Seven Critical Issues in Education: Alternatives for State Action" - a collection of papers discussing education problems. </p><p>This file also includes one summary report published by the New York State Department of Education about a multistate education conference that was titled "To Strengthen State-Local Relationships in Urban Education".

According to the Guidelines and Instructions for Preparation of Long-Range Program Planning Submissions, agencies were required to compile this data in order to assist the New York State Division of the Budget in determining annual budget needs and in identifying the long-term impact of State programs. The Guidelines identify the expansion of state government and the developments in federal assistance programs as reasons for the need of a more systematic approach by the State in coordinating the program plans of individual agencies. A copy of these Guidelines, prepared by the Division of the Budget, is included with the subseries. Not all plans appear to be complete, but their individual components have been grouped together in the files in order to represent their contextual relationship.</p></scopecontent><c id="4632146d61dc5afc45cbb2bf0d5c7c91" level="file"><did><unittitle>Division of the Budget guidelines for Long-Range Program Planning submissions</unittitle><unitdate normal="1965/1965">1965</unitdate><container altrender="Legal Document Box" id="5119b1bed48be55b2c33e67615fdbc2c" label="mixed materials [A0000000079646]" type="box">10</container><container id="5e4d34fb8e096aa2a7d70ba16b078f01" parent="5119b1bed48be55b2c33e67615fdbc2c" type="folder">93</container></did></c><c id="0e398896f106d6ee61a2f4db68aeed0b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Commission for Human Rights</unittitle><unitdate normal="1962/1965" type="inclusive">1962-1965</unitdate><container altrender="Legal Document Box" id="844f8a9bc9d0eebaca37f6af488e6bab" label="mixed materials [A0000000079646]" type="box">10</container><container id="37889fb1e54fa5becc2a5ff6d0aa4171" parent="844f8a9bc9d0eebaca37f6af488e6bab" type="folder">94</container></did><scopecontent id="f817eb46ada5568dc53ac3ffd1382187"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>In addition to the Long-Range Program Planning submission by the Commission for Human Rights, this file also contains a small pamphlet about New York State programs and legislation for advancing civil rights.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="235ecad2da60a79b823aa44328a85cdd" level="file"><did><unittitle>Education Department</unittitle><unitdate normal="1965/1965">1965</unitdate><container altrender="Legal Document Box" id="af9b029c03bd3095c79f6f0a3cc619f7" label="mixed materials [A0000000079646]" type="box">10</container><container id="a575714bb5a2e2a4b8d8c4cf0f785678" parent="af9b029c03bd3095c79f6f0a3cc619f7" type="folder">95-99</container></did><scopecontent id="f964e4ee9e624cfd10e3b1379e92e4ce"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>File contains all Long-Range Programming Plans compiled for the year 1965</p></scopecontent></c><c id="c354af7acb68fbd0455a033e7ab9e704" level="file"><did><unittitle>Education Department</unittitle><unitdate normal="1966/1966">1966</unitdate><container altrender="Legal Document Box" id="94b3a1588b760d0ac25209b1f2750815" label="mixed materials [A0000000079647]" type="box">11</container><container id="d3512169be25871d8baf0270e1cda0a9" parent="94b3a1588b760d0ac25209b1f2750815" type="folder">100-104</container></did><scopecontent id="8da828d2bf056358d52b5dc59d01ae1e"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>File includes Long-Range Programming Plans for: </p><p>1) Center on Innovation in Education;
