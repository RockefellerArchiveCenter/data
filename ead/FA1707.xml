<p>The Ford Foundation's Rights and Social Justice program promoted inclusivity, tolerance, and respect for women, racial and ethnic minorities, refugees and immigrants, and the poor of all races in the United States and around the world. Grants focused on access to education, employment, and civic participation; the enforcement of civil rights laws and policies; and development of institutions and leadership to improve the political, social, and economic status of disadvantaged groups. The program was active from 1992-1995. The program continued the work of the Foundation's Human Rights and Governance program which was active from 1982-1990 and Human Rights and Social Justice in 1991. The work in this program area continued with the Foundation's Peace and Social Justice program from 1996-2007 and the Democracy, Rights, and Justice program beginning in 2008.</p>  </bioghist>
