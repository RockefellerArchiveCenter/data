    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>From an early age, Laurance S. Rockefeller (LSR) was an avid photographer, and his photograph collection reflects this appreciation, along with the broad range of his activities and interests.
The LSR Photographs collection is sorted into several component groupings, loosely based on format, storage location (home or office), or use (e.g., Photo Reference files), at the time his collection was arranged and catalogued. </p><p>
RG 1 (FA1128), which contains LSR's loose or "flat" photo files, plus materials that were not included in other collection components at the time the collection was organized; The photo albums in RG 2 (FA1128A), document LSR's personal and family life from childhood through retirement, as well as many of his business and civic activities. RG 3 (FA1128B), LSR's Slide Books; RG 4 (FA1128C), LSR's Snapshot Files; and RG 5 (FA1128D), LSR's Photo Reference Files. RG 5 (FA1128D) also includes a subject index to LSR's albums, as well as duplicate Album prints, and an Album Negatives file.</p>  </scopecontent>
