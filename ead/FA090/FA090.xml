      <p>John H. Janney was born in Maryland and graduated from Earlham College. He took his medical training at Johns Hopkins University and then joined the Army Medical Corps in 1917. Assigned to France first as a field ambulance and battalion medical officer, he later took charge of a convalescent hospital.</p>
      <p>Dr. Janney joined the International Health Division in 1921 and was assigned to Beauford County, North Carolina as County Health Officer and then to Brazil where he organized a county health program. Returning to the United States in 1927, he studied at Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health before going to the south to work in the flood areas. In 1928, he became the Director of the County Health Training Station in Indianola, Mississippi, remaining until 1931 when he was assigned to Maryland as County Health Officer. While at Annapolis he directed the demonstration program which also functioned as a field training station for Johns Hopkins public health students.</p>
      <p>Dr. Janney's next assignment was to Romania in 1936 to do epidemiological studies on streptococcus which involved studies of scarlet fever lasting until 1940 when he was posted to Spain and Portugal to carry on public health, malaria, typhus, nursing and nutritional work. With the outbreak of WOrld War II he was reassigned to Chile where he remained until 1951. Here he acted as advisor on public health affairs, his main task being to establish a school of public health and create a full time health unit in a Santiago suburb.</p>
      <p>In 1951 Dr. Janney was transferred to Maryland as Director of Studies of the Maryland Committee on Medical Care until, in 1955, he returned again to Chile to advise the University of Chile and the Catholic University of Chile on their use of funds for the development of their medical schools. He stayed in Chile until he retired in 1959.</p>
