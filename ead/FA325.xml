    <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
<p>The central figure in the creation and operation of the Standard Oil Company during its rise to the top of the petroleum industry, John D. Rockefeller (JDR) established for the family a leading role in business and philanthropy. From the days of his earliest employment, Rockefeller, a devout Baptist, was generous in his giving to worthy causes, especially those of a religious nature. During the 1890s he developed an orderly system of philanthropic giving through an office staff that included his close advisor, Frederick T. Gates (1853-1929) and his son, John D. Rockefeller, Jr. (1874-1960). With the advise of these and other associates, Rockefeller established the University of Chicago, The Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research (now The Rockefeller University), the Rockefeller Foundation, and other philanthropic organizations working nationally and internationally in the fields of education, religion, and health. Rockefeller's total donations to philanthropic endeavors are estimated to have been $540 million.</p><p>John D. Rockefeller, Jr. (JDR Jr.) joined his father's office on October 1, 1897. He oversaw the expansion and diversification of the philanthropic work begun by his father. During his lifetime, the younger Rockefeller gave more than $537 million to educational, religious, cultural, medical, and other charitable projects.</p><p>John D. Rockefeller, Jr. and his wife, Abby Aldrich Rockefeller (1874-1948), passed the Rockefeller philanthropic impulse on to their children. Abby (1903-1976), John D. 3rd (1906-1978), Nelson A. (1908-1979), Laurance S. (1910-2004), Winthrop (1912-1973), and David (1915-2017) further expanded and diversified Rockefeller influence and interests, establishing their own philanthropic organizations, most notably the Rockefeller Brothers Fund (1940), and becoming more active politically.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
<p>The Office of the Messrs. Rockefeller (OMR) materials document the increasing role assumed by John D. Rockefeller, Jr. in the management of Rockefeller affairs and amply document his business and philanthropic affairs. They also chronicle the entrance of JDR Jr.'s sons, John D. 3rd, Nelson A., Laurance S., Winthrop, and David, into the world of business, philanthropy, civic leadership, and politics as they joined the office.</p><p>This material contains correspondence, reports, pamphlets, memoranda, deeds, maps, contracts, reports, minutes, charters, certificates of incorporation, clippings, diaries, notebooks, calendars, and memorabilia.</p><p>There is a microfilm card index of personal and institutional names.</p>  </scopecontent>

<p>The files in this series are divided into 13 subseries, as follows:</p><p>American Red Cross, Aid for the Blind, Charities, Cleveland Projects, Homes, Immigration, Jewish Organizations, Negro Organizations, Prisons and Prisoners, Prohibition and Alcoholism, Settlements, Science and Lecture Groups, United Service Organization.</p>  </arrangement>

    <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
<p>The materials in this series represent the Rockefeller family's involvement over the course of more than half a century with mainstream charitable and philanthropic organizations. With certain important exceptions, these papers focus on maintenance organizations, i.e., groups handling the chronic problems of the disabled, alcoholics, juvenile delinquents, orphans, the elderly, and the sick. For this reason, much of the correspondence and other material contained here is of a routine nature and constitutes what was once called the "citizenship" obligations of the Rockefeller family.</p><p>The interests of John D. Rockefeller, Jr. predominate in these files, in particular his interest in prohibition from about 1910 until Repeal in 1933 and his personal and financial contributions to the success of USO during World War II. Much of John D. Rockefeller, Sr.'s early interest in temperance, prohibition, and settlement work can also be traced in these papers. John D. Rockefeller 3rd, because of his conscious choice to pursue a career in philanthropy, is also well represented, in particular through his involvement with the youth work of the Community Service Society. Other members of the family appear only occasionally and then in the form of minor contributions to a few organizations.</p><p>The most historically significant material contained in the Welfare General Interests series relates to the Prohibition and Temperance movements, the support for black organizations such as the National Urban League and the NAACP, and the pervasive pattern of support for urban reform manifested by office involvement with the settlement house movement in Cleveland and New York City.</p><p>Broader streams of change can also be traced through these files, particularly the centralization of philanthropic organization which the Rockefeller family both encouraged and supported. This trend can best be seen in the emergence of the Community Service Society, the Greater New York Fund, the Welfare Council of New York, and other efforts at federation and consolidation.</p>  </scopecontent>
