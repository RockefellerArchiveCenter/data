The initial 1,064 reels are formatted on 35mm microfilm, while the remaining 8,217 reels are 16mm microfilm. Each reel of microfilm is identified by a unique box number beginning with the letter "R"; for instance R-0001, R-002, etc. However, the Grant Files were not microfilmed in numerical order. To identify which reel of microfilm a Grant File is housed on, please see the 'Reel #' field in the LINKS database.</physdesc>

<p>Each Ford Foundation Grant and the corresponding Grant File is identified by a unique Program Action (PA) number. PA numbers begin with the year a grant was made (2-digits), followed by a sequential number within that year (4-digits).</p><p>For example: PA 55-0123 was the 123rd grant made in the year 1955. PA numbers are often typed or handwritten on Ford documents in the following format:  55-123  (year)-(####).  However, the Ford Foundation's grants database (LINKS) uses an 8-digit format for PA numbers:  05500123 (0YY#####).</p><p>Beginning in the 1970s the 4th digit in the 8-digit PA number was used to encode at least three different types of Ford grants:  </p><p>0YY5####    = Unknown Code. 
0YY6####    = Grants to Individuals (see Chp. 1.1)
0YY9####    = Foundation-Administered-Projects (FAPs) (see Chp. 1.2)</p><p>After the year 2000 a "1" is used as the first digit in the 8-digit PA number to signify the 21st century. For example the 123rd grant made in 2012 would be PA number 11200123.</p><p>Grant Files were not microfilmed in numerical order, and the Ford Foundation's LINKS database must be used to identify on which microfilm reel (or reels) any specific Grant File is housed. (See below).</p><p>Each Ford Foundation Grant File is arranged into 4 sections:

                    All other correspondence and material, in reverse chronological order
A possible 5th section, 'ATTACHMENTS', will contain copies of printed ephemera &amp; clippings related to the grant. Grant Files may also be followed by a 'Grants Accounting File' which summarizes the grant.
Also, early Grant Files (roughly 1950-1970) often include a CROSS REFERENCE sheet listing other grants made in a related subject or Program Area, and a 'BIBLIOGRAPHY of GRANT-RELATED MATERIALS' at the beginning of the file.</p><p>Each Ford Foundation Grant and the corresponding Grant File is identified by a unique Program Action (PA) number.

<p>Grant Files are indexed in the Ford Foundation's grants database (LINKS). This database is not available to the public, but can be searched by RAC archivists on a researcher's behalf.</p><p>The grants database can be searched by Grant number, Grantee name, Grant purpose, Grant date, Grant amount, Grant location of concern, Grant target group, Initiative, Program officer, Program name, Subject
 
However, not all Grant Files are cataloged in the database to the fullest extent. Grants made before the 1980s are best searched for by Grant number, Grantee name, or Grant purpose.</p><p>The Ford Foundation Central Index cards, 1950-1996 (FA736) also provide indexing for Grant Files, and can be searched by institutional/organizational name, personal name, grant location, and subject.
