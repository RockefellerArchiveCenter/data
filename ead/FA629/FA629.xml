      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>The two boxes of correspondence and reports which constitute the LAC Papers of James A. Gardner, document his activities and a number of those of the International Division for the years 1971 to 1977.</p>
      <p>The papers contain material on the subject of human rights, including the Foundation's policy statement regarding biomedical research and the use of human beings as subjects. </p>
      <p>The files discuss the subject of law and its social obligations.  In particular, they illuminate such topics as law and development, social change, and how it relates to the development of human talent; the future of public interest law; and Gardner's work, "The Legal Profession and the Third World," which deals with American assistance to legal education in Latin America in the 1960's.</p>
      <p>The papers also contain related correspondence between LAC staff members and individuals who applied for the FY76 Foundation sponsored Caribbean Fellowship Fund, but whose applications were incomplete.</p>
      <p>The Correspondence Files document the day-to-day program activity of Gardner during his New York based tenure as the Program Officer/Coordinator for the Caribbean.</p>
