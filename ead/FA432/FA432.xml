    <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
<p>The Population Council was founded by John D. Rockefeller 3rd in 1952 to undertake "significant activities in the broad field of population." Its goal has been to bring about a reduction in the number of births that occur in the world. In its early years, the business of the Population Council was conducted by a Demographic Division and a Biomedical Division. Through its Demographic Division, the Council sought to document what it conceived to be an overpopulation problem threatening many areas of the world. To accomplish this purpose, the Division facilitated research on the economic, social, and psychological factors which affect the growth and decline of human population. This Council-assisted research effort was conducted not only by staff of the Demographic Division but also by other institutions and scholars, some of whom received Council grants and fellowships and some of whom received informal advice and consultation on how to design and execute studies.</p>

<p>The Biomedical Division, which, beginning in 1959, occupied a laboratory at The Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research (now The Rockefeller University), has conducted pure and applied research on plant, animal, and human reproductive physiology and on the development, the physiological action, and the safety and effectiveness of contraceptive methods. The Council facilitated similar types of medical research by non-Council scientists at other institutions by giving grants and fellowships for such research. The Council's biomedical research and its support for research by non-Council scientists were instrumental in the development of the modern intrauterine coil and the birth control pill.</p>

<p>In about 1960, the scope of Population Council activities expanded. The Council began to render practical and technical aid to foreign nations. Beginning in that year, the Demographic Division, in addition to supervising research, became involved in Pakistan's family planning program, extending practical and technical aid in organizing and running a national family planning program. By 1964 the Council's Demographic Division had assisted in organizing family planning programs in South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Tunisia, and Turkey. In that year, the Council created the Technical Assistance Division. This division, in ensuing years, continued the assistance of the Council in the countries where it had already become involved and also helped start and run programs in India, Morocco, the Philippines, and Puerto Rico.</p>

<p>An underlying aim of the Council's grant programs has been to encourage the development and growth of institutions that would promote family planning programs. To this end, the Council has given grants and advice to various universities and research centers for starting and upgrading programs for demographic and biomedical training and research programs; has assisted the United Nations to set up and expand regional Demographic Training and Research Centres in Bombay, India, Santiago, Chile, and Cairo, Egypt; has worked with the Ford Foundation on family planning programs in Pakistan, India, and North Africa.</p>

<p>In addition to rendering technical aid and sponsoring research, the Council has undertaken several complementary public relations efforts. To reach the general populations of the United States and of foreign nations, Council officers have worked to inform the mass media about population issues and to encourage magazine articles, movies, and books dealing with population matters. Council officers and representatives have also made trips and prepared reports to convince various foreign government leaders of the importance and the desirability of promulgating family planning programs. In addition, Council officers participated in and helped organize and finance conferences for demographers and medical scientists active in population work.</p>

<p>The Population Council has obtained its financial support through large contributions. The Ford and Rockefeller Foundations and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund have been the principal institutional supporters of the Council. John D. Rockefeller 3rd has been the single most significant individual backer of the Council.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
<p>The records of the Population Council document its day-to-day operation as an organization that, among other activities, evaluated and administered grants, sponsored conferences of scholars in the field of population control, and provided advice to individuals, private institutions, and governments concerned with population. There is some material relating to major policy decisions of the Council. There are also letters and reports from scientists involved in medical research and from Council staff members and representatives involved in family planning activities abroad.</p><p> The Council records are divided into two accessions. Accession 1, most of which is dated before 1967, consists of material received by the Archive Center in September, 1976. Accession 2, most of which is dated after 1966, consists primarily of material received by the Center in April, 1977.</p><p> The records of Accession 1 and Accession 2 have been kept separate because the Council evidently employed different filing systems in each of the two units and because the existence of the different filing systems sheds light on the manner in which the Council was organized and run. The use of this approach has meant that the files are organized in such a way that material relating to a given topic may appear in several different parts of the collection under either identical names or titles, or under different names or titles. For example, in the case of some institutions whose proper names are in a foreign language, records may have been filed under both the foreign name and under an English rendering of the name. The files also contain many carbon copies and there is duplication throughout the collection, so that copies of the same item may appear in several places.</p><p> To conduct a thorough search for records on a given topic, it is essential to look for material in as many different sections of the collection and under as many different names or titles as possible. For example, material relating to a given organization may be listed under the name of the organization, under the name of important figures in the organization, or under a title reflecting a study or type of work done by the organization.</p>  </scopecontent>

These were years which saw increased activity by the Population Council outside the United States, with the Council offering both practical and technical aid to other countries. These years also saw advances in two methods of birth control: in the late 1950s, the intrauterine device (IUD) grew in popularity, thanks to Dr. Jack Lippes' design; and in the early 1960s, birth control pills were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use by the general public. Regarding the IUD, Frank W. Notestein, then President of the Population Council, wrote: "Although it is too early to draw final conclusions about the intrauterine devices, it is difficult now to feel other than optimistic. Here at long last we have available a cheap and simply applied method, easily reversible, that meets the needs of a great majority of women. And we have sufficient evidence from a great diversity of countries to suggest that acceptability is high." (Source: Population Council Report for the Calendar Years 1962 and 1963) A few years later, Notestein, in writing about birth control pills, noted: "Today we also have vastly more appropriate and effective methods of contraception than were available a decade ago…The oral progestins, when taken consistently, prove to be almost 100 per cent effective and relatively safe. At the moment, the pill remains rather expensive for the poorer countries, but developments now on the horizon suggest that before long the cost of oral contraceptives will be brought down substantially." (Source: Population Council Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 1965).</p><p> These two methods of birth control, and especially the IUD, were widely promoted abroad by the Population Council. Their development at this time was a key component in the Population Council's work in other countries. Beginning in 1960, the Population Council's Demographic Division became involved in Pakistan's family planning program, offering practical and technical aid in organizing and running a national family planning program. By 1964, the Division had assisted in organizing family planning programs in South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Tunisia, and Turkey. In 1964, the Council created the Technical Assistance Division, and it was this Division which continued the Council's assistance to countries where it had already become involved and which also helped start and run programs in India, Morocco, and the Philippines.</p><p> The Foreign Correspondence files document this increased involvement in work internationally. The files are a rich source of information not only on the Population Council's work within specific countries, but also on the organization of the Population Council itself. The type of involvement varied from country to country. Often the Council simply provided technical assistance to an already existing family planning program run by the country's own Ministry of Health. At other times, the Population Council would assign an advisor who would relocate to the country concerned to live and work for one or more years. The files contain much correspondence from these resident advisors, detailing their difficulties and concerns, as well as the positive advances made in their programs. From the files it is also possible to see the tension that at times surfaced between the New York office and those working in the field – the tension between authority and autonomy.</p><p> In many countries, the Population Council would initially offer to conduct a KAP Survey – KAP being an acronym for "Knowledge, Attitude, Practice". KAP surveys could be done in a particular geographical area or with a particular people group. This survey would often reveal the need for more adequate methods of birth control and the results could be used to encourage the country's government to give more attention to the area of health and family planning.</p><p> Researchers will notice that frequently, the same material is found in multiple places within the files. This is a practice that the Population Council followed and that has been preserved within the current files. When using the materials, researchers are strongly encouraged to look at all the files within a country, not limit their study to only those files whose titles seem to be relevant to their topic. Only in this way can the relationships between the Population Council, the various government agencies, the field personnel, and other organizations, such as the Ford Foundation, be clearly seen. Because the original file titles have been preserved, the title may not adequately reveal the full content of the file.</p><p> The Monthly Reports do not comprehensively cover all the countries where the Population Council worked. They do, however, provide extensive reports for several countries where the Population Council was most involved, material which is not available in the general Country files.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_fcc2041f775d7af44d9698d789b755b6"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The Population Council's Foreign Correspondence Series is divided into two primary files.</p><p> The first, and by far the largest, consists of individual country files. The second, and much smaller, consists of monthly reports for 15 of these countries.
