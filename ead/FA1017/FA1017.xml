    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>As established by the By-Laws of 1911, the Finance Committee consisted of three elected members of the Board of Trustees to have power, subject to the regulations and limitations of the Board to make and change investments. This Committee was deemed to be in continuous session and joint action of two members was binding. Regular minutes of actions were to be kept and formal reports to be made at regular meetings of the Board.</p><p>Over the years various ammendments were made to the Rules for this Committee clarifying policies governing investments. The Treasurer of the Corporation (as of 1926) was to act as Secretary of the Committee and have custody of the Minutes and other papers and documents relating to its work. The Assistant Treasurer was to act as Assistant Secretary of the Committee.</p><p>The reorganization of 1953 left the Finance Committee at three elected members to advise the Board of Trustees and Treasurer on investments and financial policy and other powers and responsibilities as conferred by the Board of Trustees. The size of the Committee was amended in 1962 to no less than three and no more than five elected members.</p>  </bioghist>
