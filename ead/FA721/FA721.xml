They were processed in the fall of 1985, and are contained in two Hollinger boxes in the Records Storage Center. The bulk of the papers cover the period 1973 to 1974, but also include a few documents from 1971 and 1978. The records were re-housed into a single Hollinger box in 2015.</abstract>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>These papers from the Santiago, Chile field office span the years 1971 to 1978, but the vast majority deal with the period from September 1973 to September 1974. They are concerned with the effect that the September 11, 1973 military coup had on Ford Foundation grantees in Chile, and on the field office itself.</p><p>The papers are comprised primarily of memoranda between the Santiago and New York offices, memoranda among staff within the Santiago office, and outside correspondence. The memoranda include several reports on the status of grants. These note the effects that the change in government had on various Ford Foundation grantees. The papers also contain numerous clippings, in Spanish, from Chilean newspapers which provide the official account of the coup and of its aftermath. Also included in the papers are published articles, in English, which appeared in the North American press.</p><p>The papers document the Foundation's monitoring of the situation, and contain many assessments by Foundation staff of the significance of the coup, the nature of the new regime, the changed work context for the Foundation, and the future role for the Foundation in Chile. At the time of the coup, the Foundation had many grants underway in Chilean universities. The papers illustrate the high priority that the field office staff gave to documenting the changes the military made in the universities, and particularly within the social science departments. (One such change, well noted in these papers, was the May 2, 1974 decree, "Controloria Interna de la Universidad de Chile"). They also reflect the priority that the Foundation placed on assistance to displaced Chilean scholars. The Foundation was able to use its existing graduate fellowship programs, and to work with grantees such as CLACSO (Latin American Center for Social Sciences) to relocate intellectuals affected by the coup to other Latin American countries and to the United States.</p><p>The papers convey the volatility of the political environment and the uneasiness that was felt by the Ford Foundation staff in Santiago. Because of the uncertain situation, the Foundation was required to reconsider the feasibility and effectiveness of a continued Ford Foundation presence in Chile.</p><p>The papers also demonstrate the staff's concern for victims of the coup. There are some memoranda relating to the arrest of Clodomire Almeyda, Foreign Minister during much of Allende's regime, and to the detentions of Dr. Mariano Requena, Technical Director of the National Health Service, and Dr. Giorgio Solimano, Director of the Ministry of Health's nutrition programs.</p><p>There are also a few brief references to Mr. Charles Horman, including a copy of a letter from his mother, Mrs. Elizabeth Horman, to McGeorge Bundy thanking him for the Foundation's assistance during the search for her son. A good account of Mr. Horman's disappearance is contained in an October 8, 1973 letter from Mr. Richard Fagen, a former full-time consultant to the Foundation in Santiago, to Senator J. William Fulbright. However, at the time the letter was written, Mr. Horman's death had not yet been confirmed. Finally, two 1978 reports by Richard Dye, are insightful, brief analyses of Chile in the international context. They contain comments on the investigation into the 1976 assassination of Orlando Letelier, Chilean Ambassador to Washington under the Allende Administration.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Historical Sketch of Santiago Office</head>
<p>The Ford Foundation opened a field office in Santiago, Chile, in 1966. Two staff members were assigned. By 1973, there were seven residential, New York-appointed staff members in the Santiago office. After the military coup on September 11, 1973, the Foundation made plans to decrease the number of Foundation employees in Chile. At different points during the year, several of the staff members listed below were reassigned elsewhere. By September 1974 the office was closed.</p><p>From 1974 until 1981, grants to Chile were monitored by the Bogota office. In 1981, the Foundation's office in Lima became the main office for the Andean Region and the Southern Cone, and took over responsibility for grants to Chile. The papers include memoranda from the following Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) program staff:</p><p>NEW YORK-BASED STAFF
William Carmichael - Head, LAC Program
Richard Dye - Deputy Head, LAC Program
Kalman Silvert - Program Advisor</p><p>SANTIAGO-BASED STAFF
Peter Bell - Representative
Gary Horlick - Assistant Representative
Peter Hakim - Assistant Representative
Jeffrey Puryear - Program Assistant
Thomas McCarthy - Program Assistant
Nita Manitzas - Program Advisor
Lovell Jarvis - Program Advisor (1972-1973) Consultant to Chile (1974)</p>  </bioghist>
