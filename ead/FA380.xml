    <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
<p>When President Gerald R. Ford selected Nelson A. Rockefeller to fill the vacant vice presidency on August 20, 1974, Rockefeller's staff began preparing material for the confirmation hearings. Much of the material in this series was gathered from the Rockefeller family archives, which was located in Rockefeller Center.</p><p>Rockefeller's staff spent most of late August and early September preparing background data, developing drafts of testimony, and fulfilling requests for information from Congressional committee members. The files that begin this series are the products of those efforts.</p><p>Once he was confirmed and sworn in as Vice President, Rockefeller and his staff began to accumulate files anew. A new set of subject files was created, as well as files concerned with the daily activities of the Vice President. These files were periodically shipped to the family archives in New York for storage.</p>  </scopecontent>
