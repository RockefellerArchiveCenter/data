      <abstract id="aspace_dcf1cbd81d68ee1219b8c18316585a13">The Office Files of Toby Alice Volkman, Program Officer in the Ford Foundation's Education, Knowledge and Religion unit from 1995-2001, document her oversight of grants to support teaching, scholarship and publications in the field of international and area studies. The collection spans 1982-2001 and consists of correspondence, memoranda, reports, grant proposals, meeting materials and publications. Of particular interest are records pertaining to the Crossing Borders initiative, launched in 1997 under Volkman's leadership, and files from the Foundation's African Studies initiative. The files were transferred to the Ford Foundation Archives in September 2005. The arrangement of the collection follows the original order established by Volkman, though a few unfoldered and stray items have been interfiled by the processing archivist. A significant number of duplicate reports and memos were removed and discarded.</abstract>

      <head>Biographical note</head>
      <p>Toby Alice Volkman joined the Ford Foundation in 1994 as a consultant to the Education and Culture division. She was appointed Program Officer in the same area in 1995, and under a 1996 reorganization was assigned to the Education, Knowledge and Religion unit of the Education, Media, Arts and Culture program. Volkman was responsible for grantmaking to support teaching, scholarship and publications in the field of international and area studies.</p>
      <p>In 1997, the Ford Foundation launched a major initiative under Volkman's leadership. "Crossing Borders: Revitalizing Area Studies" provided $25 million over six years to enhance research and teaching about particular regions of the world and global processes that impact them. In the first phase of this initiative, Volkman oversaw 30 grants to U.S. academic institutions. In addition, a new Worldwide Fund for Area Studies supported collaborations between American colleges, universities, and institutional counterparts in Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, and Russia. </p>
      <p>Volkman also worked extensively on a Ford Foundation African Studies initiative, which supported scholarship and research in this field during the late 1990s. Her grantmaking also included support for numerous academic programs related to Southeast Asia studies. Volkman completed her assignment at the Ford Foundation in 2001. She was later a Visiting Scholar in the Department of Anthropology at New York University, and became deputy provost of New School University in 2004.</p>
      <p>Volkman holds a B.A. degree from the University of Chicago (1969) and a Ph.D. in Anthropolgy from Cornell University (1980). Her dissertation focused on the cultural anthropology of the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. From 1980-1985, Volkman was Staff Anthropologist at Documentary Educational Resources. Her book Feasts of Honor: Ritual and Change in Tana Toraja was published by the University of Ilinois in 1985. She was Director, South and Southeast Asia Programs of the Social Science Research Council from 1986-1994.</p>

      <head>Organizational history</head>
      <p>Ford Foundation grants to academic and research institutions working to broaden and organize knowledge about specific world regions dates from the 1950s. The Foundation was a primary force behind the establishment of area studies programs in the United States, and granted hundreds of millions of dollars to support graduate scholarship through its International Training and Research Program. In later years, the Ford Foundation maintained its commitment to the field by funding the Social Science Research Council and the American Council of Learned Societies, which in turn supported area studies scholars and programs.</p>
      <p>"Crossing Borders: Revitalizing Area Studies" was a special initiative launched by the Ford Foundation in 1997. Drawing upon the Foundation’s deep experience with support of scholarship focused on world regions, this initiative sought to reinvigorate the field, to stimulate a critical rethinking of its parameters, and to encourage broader funding by government, universities and philanthropies. This effort was, in part, a response to intellectual critiques of area studies motivated by demographic shifts, the internationalization of scholarship and the popularity of multiculturalism and post-colonial theory. At the same time, dwindling institutional support for language study, travel and other components of area studies weakened programs and underscored the need for fresh philanthropic commitment to the field.</p>
      <p>Crossing Borders began with thirty grants of $50,000 each to support area studies programs in a wide range of institutions. Eventually, more than fifty Crossing Borders grants were made, running through 2005. Funded projects included Duke University's "Oceans Connect," which fostered research on cultural and economic linkages across maritime basins, a faculty-student research group at Colby College charged with restructuring the institution's junior year abroad program, and research collaborations between Hunter College students and faculty and the staff of several New York-based human rights NGOs. From 1997-2001, Crossing Borders was headed by Ford Foundation Program Officer Toby Alice Volkman. It was a special initiative of the Education, Knowledge and Religion unit of the Foundation's Education, Media, Arts and Culture division.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>The Office Files of Toby Alice Volkman document grantmaking to support international and area studies programs at academic and research institutions during the period 1982-2001. A substantial portion of the collection relates to the Crossing Borders initiative, 1997-2001. Also included are records pertaining to a Foundation initiative to support African Studies, and files on dozens of additional grants for international and area studies.

          <p>Series III includes files on individual grants to support international and area studies programs that were not exclusively connected with the Crossing Borders or African Studies initiatives. Many are focused on Southeast Asian studies, a field of particular interest to Volkman. Also included are files on conferences, workshops and planning meetings where Volkman and her colleagues formulated their agenda to reinvigorate area studies. This material is complemented by copies of several of Volkman's "Reflection Memos."</p>
