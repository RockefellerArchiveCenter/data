<p>The Ford Foundation was chartered by Henry and Edsel Ford in 1936 "to receive and administer funds for scientific, educational and charitable purposes, all for the public welfare", and initially served the Ford family's charitable interests in the Detroit area. Following the deaths of Edsel Ford (1943) and Henry Ford (1947), the Foundation was propelled to the forefront of philanthropy as the largest American foundation in terms of both endowment and yearly expenditures, and with an international scope to its major program areas. During the Foundation's first twenty years its major programs were in international economic development, primary and higher education, educational and public broadcasting, behavioral sciences, civil liberties, urban development, fine arts and the humanities. The Ford Foundation also partnered with the Rockefeller Foundation in supporting agricultural development in South America, Africa, and Southeast Asia. Since the 1970s, the Foundation has also pioneered programs in women's rights, energy policy, micro-financing in under-developed countries, establishing human rights groups, and improving international HIV/AIDS education.</p>  </bioghist>

Carter. Carter created the records through carrying out her different administrative responsibilities in the Ford Foundation's European and International Affairs Program. The correspondence in the files is comprised of letters and memos that were sent between Carter and different EIA program officers, consultants, grantees, support staff, and Program Officers in Charge, Craufurd Goodwin and Francis Sutton. These materials document Carter's duties for reviewing different grant-related records, handling the appointments and payments of program consultants, and compiling and managing different types of data and information for the program. </p><p>
The Overseas Development Institute (ODI) and the American Council of Learned Societies (ACLS) are amongst some of the grantees that the materials regard. Prominent focus areas of the EIA's grant giving activities during the time that Carter worked as Assistant Administrative Officer include arms control research and the study of different European regions. The series also holds some material regarding the Ford Foundation Paris Field Office which operated from 1970 to 1975. Later records in the series concern the EIA staff's review and discussion of the program's administration as well as possible reorganization of the program.</p></scopecontent><c id="edfe6eef1a4ec795ebfda912790bfb6a" level="file"><did><unittitle>Chronological file</unittitle><unitdate normal="1968/1971" type="inclusive">1968-1971</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="7f62c7f35688e95b9b3e423bb8d4256e" label="Mixed Materials [A0000000082894]" type="box">1</container><container id="d2571627d8099b7f2ec8e169602374dc" parent="7f62c7f35688e95b9b3e423bb8d4256e" type="folder">1-3</container></did></c><c id="0828b6afd41ea75579a2d36657614c82" level="file"><did><unittitle>Chronological file</unittitle><unitdate normal="1971/1973" type="inclusive">1971-1973</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="be387cd9e5db3ad33a67bca1299db7b3" label="Mixed Materials [A0000000082894]" type="box">1</container><container id="f3202e0419c6b52310c7f6a438dfb659" parent="be387cd9e5db3ad33a67bca1299db7b3" type="folder">4-6</container></did></c><c id="905d1c06bf2055ce8f8028f9f756ff15" level="file"><did><unittitle>Chronological file</unittitle><unitdate normal="1974/1974">1974</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="f89f6f050d39b4232727ce559afafee4" label="Mixed Materials [A0000000082895]" type="box">2</container><container id="86c930054d3a54b5245d813a4b5c054c" parent="f89f6f050d39b4232727ce559afafee4" type="folder">7-8</container></did></c><c id="f01d48dd0acc6f5e18eb55e8d599be0c" level="file"><did><unittitle>Chronological file</unittitle><unitdate normal="1975/1975">1975</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="87dcfef473f80a909d36099faa4f83b9" label="Mixed Materials [A0000000082895]" type="box">2</container><container id="ee898411dfdd08e506b31f9f115ca5c2" parent="87dcfef473f80a909d36099faa4f83b9" type="folder">9-10</container></did></c><c id="b5c8586a1777e3c0bd4d8c4312b204da" level="file"><did><unittitle>Chronological file</unittitle><unitdate normal="1967/1976" type="inclusive">1967, 1976</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="c4c71f09324765e625ad1002d1bd12bc" label="Mixed Materials [A0000000082895]" type="box">2</container><container id="1faf7d761f02b48e2fe69d562b55aff9" parent="c4c71f09324765e625ad1002d1bd12bc" type="folder">11-13</container></did></c><c id="55d794b3e24dbd89a33c9ae9e6865a59" level="file"><did><unittitle>Chronological file</unittitle><unitdate normal="1977/1977">1977</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="eec06dce21c6edf87574e6e6b0054d0d" label="Mixed Materials [A0000000082896]" type="box">3</container><container id="8dc2d86531a58f8943dc9db55d8ebb9c" parent="eec06dce21c6edf87574e6e6b0054d0d" type="folder">14-16</container></did></c><c id="06b6ccde1834fb9cb6e4f41a3d0c15b8" level="file"><did><unittitle>Chronological file</unittitle><unitdate normal="1975/1978" type="inclusive">1975, 1978</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="ac8cd5b4af1970374b7b88a810cc0dbb" label="Mixed Materials [A0000000082896]" type="box">3</container><container id="a94e6f4e9666258577cbd38a193520d8" parent="ac8cd5b4af1970374b7b88a810cc0dbb" type="folder">17-18</container></did></c><c id="59c68de75f5118b08e5ed593595c3605" level="file"><did><unittitle>Chronological file</unittitle><unitdate normal="1979/1979">1979</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="5ce9ee13444a325a7e0d979a5e6e4078" label="Mixed Materials [A0000000082896]" type="box">3</container><container id="369e37ede2537fb9c94ffac495c53236" parent="5ce9ee13444a325a7e0d979a5e6e4078" type="folder">19-20</container></did></c><c id="17f134206afda5acaf9c74dd6e153bbf" level="file"><did><unittitle>Chronological file</unittitle><unitdate normal="1951/1980" type="inclusive">1951-1953, 1979-1980</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="ab37b42b60aa7aae56a506b7a087d733" label="Mixed Materials [A0000000082897]" type="box">4</container><container id="1e7098d0d9c30c5630a371bd7bf4453c" parent="ab37b42b60aa7aae56a506b7a087d733" type="folder">21-23</container></did></c><c id="21c67dd15ece9153ad1543e0d34cfd15" level="file"><did><unittitle>Chronological file</unittitle><unitdate normal="1980/1981" type="inclusive">1980-1981</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="a45c963db5394b8b92ef34fd25b10ac2" label="Mixed Materials [A0000000082897]" type="box">4</container><container id="06c27dcb632662312f23afffe672c3b5" parent="a45c963db5394b8b92ef34fd25b10ac2" type="folder">24-25</container></did></c></c></dsc>
