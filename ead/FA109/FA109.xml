    <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
<p>Edgar B. Young, a staff associate of John D. Rockefeller 3rd (JDR 3rd), played a vital role in the creation and early administration of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts.</p><p>Young was born April 27, 1908, in Anderson, Indiana. His academic credentials include an A.B. from DePauw University (1929) and graduate work at the London School of Economics (Economics 1931), the University of Pennsylvania (Economics 1933), and American University (Public Administration 1935).</p><p>Prior to his employment as a Rockefeller family associate, Young held several administrative positions in the U. S. Employment Service (1934-1939) and the U. S. Bureau of the Budget (1939-1941). He also served as an Assistant to the Executive Director of the Port of New York Authority (1945-1946). From 1946 to 1949, Young began his service to the Rockefeller family as a staff associate of John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Then in 1949, he became the full-time staff associate for JDR 3rd and served in that capacity throughout the time period of the balance of the records documented in this collection.</p><p>Young's career closely mirrors the interests and activities of JDR 3rd. In the early 1950s, JDR 3rd devoted much of his energy to the promotion of a greater cultural and educational exchange between Asia and western societies, most notably the United States. These activities centered around the revitalization of the Japan Society, for which Young was appointed Secretary in 1952, and the creation of the Asia Society, for which Young was appointed Secretary upon its founding in 1956.</p><p>Young was actively involved in the Lincoln Center project from its origin, participating in many of the early discussions while JDR 3rd served on the Exploratory Committee for a Musical Arts Center. After incorporation, Young became Lincoln Center's Secretary (1956-1962) and JDR 3rd became its first President (June 22, 1956-1961). Rockefeller was succeeded as President by General Maxwell Taylor on January 4, 1961. Following Taylor's resignation to accept a position as military advisor for President John F. Kennedy, Young served as the Acting President of Lincoln Center from June 26 to December 31, 1961. At that time, William Schuman was named the third President of Lincoln Center (1961-1968) and Young was subsequently appointed Executive Vice President (1962-1965) and Chairman of the Building Committee (1961-1971). Young also often served as a member of both the Executive and Education Committees at various points throughout his tenure with Lincoln Center.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
<p>Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts is a nonprofit institution dedicated to fostering the arts of opera, music, dance, drama, and arts education. Its objective is not only to exist as a physical place where the arts are created and performed, but also to promote and facilitate access to the arts to as wide an audience as possible.</p><p>The Edgar B. Young collection documents Lincoln Center as a project fueled by the work and vision of volunteers and the non-profit sector of the economy. It serves as a model of successful urban renewal and collaboration between the private sector and various agencies of all levels of government.</p><p>The birth of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts developed from the convergence of three independent actions. First was the availability of land. In 1954, the New York City Committee on Slum Clearance (under the chairmanship of Robert Moses and Mayor Robert Wagner) designated a 17-block area of Manhattan between West 62nd and West 70th Streets for redevelopment. Once the appropriate city government approvals were obtained, this became the Lincoln Square Urban Renewal Project (with Lincoln Square as the intersection of Broadway and Columbus Avenue). Second and third, two major New York art associations, the Metropolitan Opera Association and the Philharmonic-Symphony Society, were both actively and independently looking for new homes. Both organizations had independently come to the conclusion that building a new home to fit their custom specifications and acoustic requirements, rather than becoming a tenant in an existing structure, was essential for their performers and the long term existence and growth of their organizations.</p><p>The catalyst for the convergence of these independent activities into one interrelated project was Wallace K. Harrison who had been asked to serve as the design architect for both the new Metropolitan Opera House and the Philharmonic Hall project. Harrison also had a long standing relationship with various New York City government officials as well as the Rockefeller family. Harrison met with John D. Rockefeller 3rd, Chair of the Board of the Rockefeller Foundation at the time, and Young to discuss the dilemma confronting the Metropolitan Opera and the Philharmonic as well as possible solutions. Young and JDR 3rd were interested in further participation and soon after met with other prominent art administrators including Lincoln Kirstein (Managing Director of the New York City Ballet) and William Shuman (President of the Juilliard School). On the invitation of Charles Spofford (Metropolitan Opera Association Executive Committee Chairman), JDR 3rd attended informal meetings with many of these same men, leading to the establishment of the Exploratory Committee for a Musical Arts Center with the objective of defining a common mission and building a performing arts center. This committee eventually led to the incorporation of Lincoln Center in 1956 and, after decades of planning, designing and redesigning, construction and reconstruction, the opening and operation of the nation's largest performing arts complex.</p><p>The Edgar B. Young Papers document Young's professional career with Lincoln Center and, to a much lesser extent, the Japan Society. This is not a collection of his personal papers. Due to Young's extensive experience in a wide variety of Lincoln Center positions and activities, this collection documents all aspects of the Lincoln Center project including the origin of Lincoln Center, Inc.; the planning, construction, and completion of each of the original buildings; early administration and operations; constituent relations; fundraising; financial administration; public relations; and the adoption of various sponsored programs beyond the original scope of its mandate such as the Lincoln Center Student Program, the Lincoln Center Film Festival, and sponsorship of the New York World's Fair.</p>  </scopecontent>

Each constituent negotiated its own contract with Lincoln Center, Inc. and subsequently abided by their individual agreements. Correspondence, negotiations and/or agreements are available with all the founding and major constituents as well as the early potential constituents including: The Philharmonic-Symphony Society, The Metropolitan Opera Association, Juilliard School, Library/Museum of the Performing Arts, the Repertory Theater of Lincoln Center, the Chamber Music Society, New York Shakespeare Festival, and the Film Society of Lincoln Center, Inc. Of special note are the agreements with Lincoln Center, Inc. of the Metropolitan Opera Association and the Philharmonic-Symphony Society as well as documentation of the special subcommittee on the Philharmonic musicians strike and the subsequent revision of the Philharmonic agreement (1973).</p><p>This subseries also documents the longstanding negotiations with the City Center of Music and Drama, Inc., leading to its constituency in 1965. Minutes of the meetings of the Lincoln Center Council (1957-1962, 1968-1971) are contained here as well.</p></scopecontent><c id="85e8b450291841b099fbed47dea1a622" level="file"><did><unittitle>The Chamber Music Society</unittitle><unitdate normal="1967/1967" type="inclusive">1967</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Storage Box" id="a9b0e0cba83d79396a354f12cf249560" label="mixed materials [A0000000041832]" type="box">16</container><container id="1535eceaaf9b82b8c48ba819e19887bc" parent="a9b0e0cba83d79396a354f12cf249560" type="folder">179</container></did></c><c id="0b4b3efc1f44446388389c3576d5f15f" level="file"><did><unittitle>The Chamber Music Society</unittitle><unitdate normal="1968/1970" type="inclusive">1968-1970</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Storage Box" id="e62de1c1f46d293025d38072c2d4fa9c" label="mixed materials [A0000000041832]" type="box">16</container><container id="235e7c1e72489500007bcc91d3f7c990" parent="e62de1c1f46d293025d38072c2d4fa9c" type="folder">180</container></did></c><c id="5cc3aebf8d75492caf8f16f99429696f" level="file"><did><unittitle>The City Center of Music and Drama, Inc. -

note</head><p>Lincoln Center, Inc., as a nonprofit institution with no accumulated financial reserves and no corporate or commercial means of financing, originally envisioned a private-sector fundraising campaign seeking the support of individual donors and organizational grants. Due to expansion of the project and rising capital costs, Lincoln Center also sought city, state, and federal government funding, but the private sector remained the source of a majority of the funding, and acquiring such funds remained a top priority. This subseries documents the private fundraising campaign. The largest organization grants were submitted by the Ford Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation as well as the Avalon Foundation. Monumental personal pledges were received early on from John D. Rockefeller Jr. and John D. Rockefeller 3rd, which helped to solidify the ultimate success of the project as well as spur the Lincoln Center Campaign toward greater and more diversified support. Also noteworthy are the gifts by Vivian Beaumont Allen and Alice Tully for the theaters that bear their respective names.</p></scopecontent><c id="742ff3048e9e4213bc356d69a499ce6a" level="file"><did><unittitle>Anonymous Gift of Real Estate</unittitle><unitdate>1958-1959</unitdate><container id="b89e1a8a900f51d81a8c615374469161" label="mixed materials [113962.30.318]" type="box">30</container><container id="71b3e7adb887c94224c201aae5fb6a79" parent="b89e1a8a900f51d81a8c615374469161" type="folder">349</container></did></c><c id="822019b03c364936849d4caf8a2f77a3" level="file"><did><unittitle>Anonymous Gift of Real Estate</unittitle><unitdate>1960-1961</unitdate><container id="f46eebd696aa8910e98bbfaf222cbe33" label="mixed materials [113962.30.318]" type="box">30</container><container id="8b50104559a09d5fbc44112008e988af" parent="f46eebd696aa8910e98bbfaf222cbe33" type="folder">350</container></did></c><c id="047cdec77e5d4f6cb4faa50fda5ff045" level="file"><did><unittitle>Austrian Gift</unittitle><unitdate>1963-1967</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Storage Box" id="072e25243a414099317b2315f17664a6" label="mixed materials [A0000000041847]" type="box">31</container><container id="31aee7dc961844dbd9cc2ec6613f48ad" parent="072e25243a414099317b2315f17664a6" type="folder">351</container></did></c><c id="1790dfd0c9d34dc283fad9122103b4f1" level="file"><did><unittitle>Avalon Foundation</unittitle><unitdate>1957-1961</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Storage Box" id="420c339209c2efacd9c7fe9a88f69d3d" label="mixed materials [A0000000041847]" type="box">31</container><container id="e3d4cff94e6e58e8ca610bd916aea056" parent="420c339209c2efacd9c7fe9a88f69d3d" type="folder">352</container></did></c><c id="da8acd863c414a4dbfbf4d2a1b4636c9" level="file"><did><unittitle>Mrs. V.

The files of the Building Committee and its various Subcommittees are also available.</p><p>Wallace K. Harrison served as the design architect for the Lincoln Center complex, developing and executing the overall site plan. Planning and construction of each of the Lincoln Center buildings was a separate and contractually independent project with its own custom architectural and engineering specifications, its own design architect and construction firm, and its own budget and completion schedule. The design architects for each individual building within the complex are: Philharmonic Hall - Max Abramovitz; Metropolitan Opera House - Wallace K. Harrison; New York State Theater - Philip Johnson; Vivian Beaumont Theater - Eero Saarinen; Library/Museum (physically connected to the Vivian Beaumont Theater) - Gordon Bunshaft; Juilliard School and Alice Tully Hall - Pietro Belluschi. Various acoustic and stage alterations following building completion are also documented including the Bolt, Beranek and Newman acoustics study, and subsequent alterations, of Philharmonic Hall.</p><p>Another vital aspect of the Lincoln Center project is the negotiations, agreements, and public funding obtained, from the city and state of New York and the federal government. Of particular note is the agreement by Lincoln Center to host the performing arts activities of the New York World's Fair (1964-1965) and the subsequent state funding obtained for what became the New York State Theater. As a result of this agreement Lincoln Center was contractually obligated to complete the New York State Theater and its Promenade, as well as several other portions of the complex, for the World's Fair.</p></scopecontent><c id="d3b4406a33a44e1aaa27cd861120776d" level="file"><did><unittitle>Architects -

Lincoln Center's role as the performing arts arm of the New York World's Fair (1964-1965) is also documented.</p><p>Public Relations press kits help illuminate two important events in the history of Lincoln Center. The first is a press kit from January 20, 1959 announcing the inclusion of Fordham University in the Lincoln Square Urban Renewal Project. Following public and legal opposition to the use of government funding to support a non-secular institution (which eventually resulted in the U.S. Supreme Court dismissal of the case), Fordham University purchased the land from West 60th to West 62nd Street between Columbus and Amsterdam Avenues and built housing for their Law School and Liberal Arts College. As the owner of its own land and facilities, Fordham University is a neighbor in Lincoln Square adjacent to Lincoln Center, but is not a constituent of Lincoln Center and was never offered, nor eligible, for such status. (Correspondence and legal documents regarding this Church-State Issue are available in Subseries 9 - Planning and Construction.) The second is a press kit from the Lincoln Center Groundbreaking Ceremony on May 14, 1959, attended by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, John D.

Rockefeller 3rd, to promote greater cultural understanding and cooperation between Japan and the United States. The Japan Society has developed and sponsored programs in the arts, business, education, and public affairs. These programs often include Japanese art exhibitions, films, performances, a lecture series, public policy research projects, educational fellowships, and sponsored classes in cultural and language studies for children and adults.</p><p>Due to its small size and limited time span, the holdings in this series only give a glimpse of the work of the Japan Society and Edgar Young's role in the organization.</p></scopecontent><c id="5274ea9a92cf4a31ba5e6f14c405345b" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Administration</unittitle><unitid>1</unitid></did><scopecontent

Young , a staff associate of John D. Rockefeller 3rd, played a vital role in the creation and early administration of Lincoln Center. Edgar B. Young was born April 27, 1908 in Anderson, IN. His academic credentials include an A.B. from DePauw University (1929) and post graduate degrees from the London School of Economics (Economics 1931), the University of Pennsylvania (Economics 1933), and American University (Public Administration 1935). Young was actively involved in the Lincoln Center project from its origin, participating in many of the early discussions while JDR 3rd served on the Exploratory Committee for a Musical Arts Center. After incorporation, Young became Lincoln Center's Secretary (1956-1962), and JDR 3rd became its first President (June 22, 1956-1961). Young also often served as a member of both the Executive and Education Committees at various points throughout his tenure with Lincoln Center. The Edgar B. Young collection documents Lincoln Center as a project fueled by the work and vision of volunteers and the non-profit sector of the economy. It serves as a model of successful urban renewal and collaboration between the private sector and various agencies of all levels of government. The photographs in this collection have been extracted from the print collection and relocated to Series 3.</p></scopecontent><odd id="4a8fa47aa7bdb168c3499e8df2e3e01e"><head>General note</head><p>A total of one box of photographs have been extracted from the Edgar B.

Future processing will rebox and relabel the contents to reflect their designation as Series 3, and take further steps to stabilize and preserve the items as necessary.</p></fileplan><c id="dfb07bb4030c498da923d6433e9e93d2" level="file"><did><unittitle>Lincoln Center, Inc.
