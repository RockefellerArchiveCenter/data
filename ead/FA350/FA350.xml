    <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
<p>Nelson Aldrich Rockefeller was born on July 8, 1908, in Bar Harbor, Maine, the third child of John Davison Rockefeller, Jr., and Abby Aldrich Rockefeller. He graduated from the Lincoln School of Teachers College at Columbia University in New York City in 1926. Mr. Rockefeller attended Dartmouth College where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa, graduating cum laude in 1930 with an A.B. degree in economics.</p><p>After college, Mr. Rockefeller was active in family enterprises, including real estate, banking, and family philanthropies. His major business interests in time became focused on Rockefeller Center and Latin America. In 1938, he became the president of Rockefeller Center.</p><p>In 1935, because of his interest in national affairs and his desire to learn about U.S. business abroad, Mr. Rockefeller became a director of Creole Petroleum Company, the Venezuelan subsidiary of Standard Oil of New Jersey. This association led eventually to his deep, life-long interest in Latin America. He made extensive visits to Latin America in 1937 and 1939 to study economic, social, and political conditions. He resigned his directorship in the Creole Petroleum Company in 1940.</p><p>In 1940, Mr. Rockefeller and his four brothers organized the Rockefeller Brothers Fund to carry out a broad range of philanthropic activities.</p><p>Throughout his life Mr. Rockefeller was an avid supporter of the arts. He served as a trustee, treasurer, president, and chair of the board of the Museum of Modern Art, which was cofounded by his mother. In 1954, he founded the Museum of Primitive Art, which collected of indigenous art of the Americas, Africa, Oceania, and early Asia and Europe.</p><p>After his 1939 visit to Latin America, Mr. Rockefeller prepared a memorandum for President Franklin D. Roosevelt outlining his deep concern over Nazi influence and penetration into that part of the world. In the memo he recommended a U.S. program of cooperation with the nations of the western hemisphere to achieve better relations among these nations and to help raise their standards of living. Largely as a result of this memo, President Roosevelt asked Mr. Rockefeller in August of 1940 to initiate and head a new program ultimately known as the Office of Inter-American Affairs. Mr. Rockefeller served as Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs, his first full-time position in public service.</p><p>Mr. Rockefeller served in this position until December 1944, when President Roosevelt appointed him Assistant Secretary of State for American Republic Affairs. In this post, Mr. Rockefeller initiated the Inter-American Conference on Problems of War and Peace in Mexico City in February of 1945. It resulted in the Act of Chapultepec, which provided the framework for economic, social, and defense cooperation among the nations of the western hemisphere and set the principle that an attack on one of these nations would be regarded as an attack on all and jointly resisted.</p><p>Mr. Rockefeller signed the Act of Chapultepec on behalf of the United States. He also attended the United Nations Conference on International Organization in San Francisco in 1945. At the conference, there was considerable opposition to the idea of permitting, within the UN Charter, the formation of regional pacts such as the Act of Chapultepec. Mr. Rockefeller, who believed that the inclusion was essential, especially to U.S. policy in Latin America, successfully argued the need for regional pacts within the framework of the United Nations. The importance of this victory was underscored by the subsequent formation of NATO, SEATO, and the Rio Pact.</p><p>During these war-time years, Mr. Rockefeller also served as Chairman of the Inter-American Development Commission, which was established in June 1940 to reorganize and revitalize Latin American economies following the loss of European markets. He was also the U.S. Co-Chairman of the Mexican-American Development Commission to help Mexico emerge as an industrial nation in the transition from war to peace.</p><p>Mr. Rockefeller resigned as Assistant Secretary of State on August 24, 1945.</p><p>Upon his return to private life in New York in 1946, Mr. Rockefeller became chair of the board of Rockefeller Center and undertook a program of physical expansion. Two other initiatives during this period illustrate Mr. Rockefeller's continuing interest in Latin America and international economic development. In July of 1946, the Rockefeller brothers established a philanthropic organization, the American International Association for Economic and Social Development (AIA). AIA financed nonprofit projects to ameliorate health, educational, agricultural, and other social problems in the poorer areas of Latin America. Nelson Rockefeller served as President from July 1946 to June 1953 and from January 1957 to December 1958. In 1947, he organized the International Basic Economy Corporation (IBEC), a business corporation to help raise living standards in foreign countries through new economic enterprises. In its early years, IBEC concentrated on enterprises in Latin America but later expanded its activities to other regions. Mr. Rockefeller served as IBEC President from January 1947 to June 1953 and from January 1956 to December 1958.</p><p>In his inaugural address in January 1949, President Harry S. Truman announced the Point IV program for providing technical assistance to developing nations. This concept was based in part on programs Mr. Rockefeller and his associates had developed through the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs and the private, philanthropic AIA. In November of 1950, President Truman asked Mr. Rockefeller to serve as Chairman of the International Development Advisory Board. The Board was charged with recommending policies for carrying out the Point IV program. The Board's report, entitled "Partners in Progress," provided the basic blueprint for America's foreign assistance program.</p><p>On November 20, 1952, President-elect Dwight D. Eisenhower asked Mr. Rockefeller to serve as Chairman of the President's Advisory Committee on Government Organization, a group created to recommend ways to improve the efficiency of the executive branch of the government. As Chairman of that committee, Mr. Rockefeller recommended 13 reorganization plans to the President, 10 of which were approved by Congress. These plans achieved basic changes in the organization of the Department of Defense, the Department of Agriculture, and the Office of Defense Mobilization, among others. Another of the plans led to the establishment of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. In June 1953, Mr. Rockefeller was appointed Under Secretary of the new department. He was especially active in the department's legislative program, recommending measures that covered an additional ten million people under the Social Security program. He resigned as HEW Under Secretary in 1954 to become Special Assistant to the President for Foreign Affairs.</p><p>While serving as Special Assistant, Mr. Rockefeller played a key role in the development of the "Open Skies" proposal for checking on world armaments through mutual air reconnaissance. He accompanied President Eisenhower to the Geneva Summit Conference in 1955, where the plan was proposed to the world by the President. Mr. Rockefeller resigned as Special Assistant on December 31, 1955.</p><p>Mr. Rockefeller first ran for public office in 1958 and was elected Governor of New York on November 4, defeating incumbent Averill Harriman. He took office January 1, 1959, and was subsequently re-elected Governor three more times, thus becoming the first Governor in the nation's history to be elected to four 4-year terms.</p><p>Nelson Rockefeller's tenure as a public servant in the federal government was a formative period in his life. By the time he left Washington to assume the governorship of New York, he had received a thorough education in the workings of the federal government. His chairmanship of PACGO permitted him to examine every aspect of the executive branch. This and his work in HEW exposed him to a wide variety of domestic issues. He gained experience in initiating legislation, in foreign policy and diplomacy, in domestic and international economics, and in national security and military affairs. In the process he also received an education in national politics and gained a reputation for being an effective and hardworking administrator. Most importantly, these appointments provided him with the opportunity to form the friendships and personal associations that served him throughout his political career.</p><p>Mr. Rockefeller resigned as Governor of New York in December 1973. In August 1974, President Gerald R. Ford nominated him to fill the vacant vice presidency following the resignation of President Richard M. Nixon. Mr. Rockefeller served as Vice President from December 19, 1974, to January 20, 1977. Nelson Rockefeller died on January 26, 1979, in New York City.</p>  </bioghist>

Roosevelt that expressed concern over Nazi influence in that region and recommended a program of U.S. cooperation and assistance to raise the standard of living in Latin America and to improve relations between the nations of the western hemisphere. President Roosevelt responded by appointing Rockefeller to head a new program that became the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the agency coordinated the strategic defense of the region in the fields of information, economics, health, sanitation, agriculture, transportation, and culture and actively worked to frustrate Axis propaganda campaigns and economic designs on Latin America.</p><p>This subseries includes 6 cubic feet of correspondence and 19 cubic feet of bound printed material such as reports, newsletters, circulars issued by the various divisions of the OCIAA, and a complete set of "En Guardia," a Spanish-language picture magazine about the war that was produced and distributed by the OCIAA. There are also 15 reels of microfilm containing office correspondence: 6 reels of abstracts of incoming correspondence and 9 reels of complete outgoing correspondence. This correspondence may duplicate some of that within the paper files, but it does include additional correspondence as well.</p><p>Also found in this subseries are 61 motion picture films produced and distributed under the auspices of the OCIAA during the years 1940-1944. There is a substantial amount of documentation about the films in the papers of this series. These films appear to be NAR's personal copies. In 1942 the CIAA contracted with Walt Disney to produce 18 films, all of which exist at the Archive Center. The Julien Bryan films were produced for a primary and secondary level school audience. The films are in English or Spanish and address health, education, and cultural issues. The films are presented by the CIAA and are live-action in presentation unless otherwise noted.</p></scopecontent><c id="fcf8859542a3431a8929e9de97fbf79b" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="Audiovisual materials"><did><unittitle>Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs (CIAA)</unittitle></did><bioghist id="aspace_893cbd2ba6da2b4ee8ab394293c21f00"><head>Biographical / Historical</head><p>Under Nelson Rockefeller, the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs was created to support various health and social wellness initiatives, as well as to maintain cultural and commercial relations between North and South America.

Eisenhower asked Rockefeller to chair a committee to study the executive branch of the federal government and recommend ways to streamline its organization and improve its efficiency and effectiveness. The committee was known progressively by three different names, which are reflected in the three titles in this subseries. As chairman, Rockefeller recommended 13 reorganization plans, 10 of which were approved by Congress. In 1953, Rockefeller also served as chairman of the Special Committee on the Reorganization of the Defense Department. Its recommendations were also accepted and approved. The records of his service in that committee are included in this subseries. The PACGO material also includes published reports and correspondence concerning two earlier government organization studies: the Hoover Commission and the Temple University Survey of Government Organization.</p></scopecontent><c id="b778503c6ca049f1b0395751a5904fad" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Special Committee on Government Organization

Nixon requested that Rockefeller consult with the leaders of the Latin American republics and determine the needs and conditions of those countries. In four separate trips during 1969, Rockefeller and a team of advisors visited 20 South American, Central American, and Caribbean republics. His advisors represented the fields of labor, cultural affairs, urban affairs, women's affairs, youth, media, finance and economics, and private enterprise. While Mr. Rockefeller met with the head of state and foreign minister of each country, the advisors met with public and private representatives of their respective fields. This subseries includes briefing books on each country provided by the U.S. Department of State, correspondence with Latin American and U.S. ambassadors, country reports prepared by the advisors, Rockefeller's notes from his meetings with heads of state, and drafts of the final report to Congress and President Nixon. (Note: Some documents in this subseries bear U.S. government security classifications and therefore remain closed.)</p></scopecontent><c id="c3b8fd27ac02411482d33d321cfa30ed" level="file"><did><unittitle>Argentina -

Any document that remains classified since the review has been removed from its folder and replaced with a separation sheet to note its original and current locations. Therefore, all materials in the open folders are now declassified, whether or not the classification stamps on them indicate otherwise. Almost all of the declassified documents prominently display a federal agency's declassification stamp and date.</p></accessrestrict><relatedmaterial id="708d4a48829e701a2baf075f6b2e5c0e"><head>Related Materials</head><p>In the printed folder list, researchers may wish to refer to the column labeled, "See Also." It lists the folders within Subseries 7 and 8 of this series that are on the same topic but contain documents that were never classified.
