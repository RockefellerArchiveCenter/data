<p>The Ford Foundation was chartered by Henry and Edsel Ford in 1936 "to receive and administer funds for scientific, educational and charitable purposes, all for the public welfare", and initially served the Ford family's charitable interests in the Detroit area. Following the deaths of Edsel Ford (1943) and Henry Ford (1947), the Foundation was propelled to the forefront of philanthropy as the largest American foundation in terms of both endowment and yearly expenditures, and with an international scope to its major program areas. During the Foundation's first twenty years its major programs were in international economic development, primary and higher education, educational and public broadcasting, behavioral sciences, civil liberties, urban development, fine arts and the humanities. The Ford Foundation also partnered with the Rockefeller Foundation in supporting agricultural development in South America, Africa, and Southeast Asia. Since the 1970s, the Foundation has also pioneered programs in women's rights, energy policy, micro-financing in under-developed countries, establishing human rights groups, and improving international HIV/AIDS education.</p>  </bioghist>

Files document Ogata's work as Co-Chair of the United Nations Commission on Human Security (CHS) as well as her involvement in the larger international peace and governance field. </p><p>
Most of the files regarding the CHS appear to have been created in the context of its Third Meeting in June 2002 in Stockholm, Sweden. Nevertheless, these files and other ones in the series also contain materials that document the earlier history of the commission such as press releases announcing the formation of the CHS. Other records pertaining to the commission include correspondence, drafts, reports, talking points Ogata wrote for meetings, meeting agendas, and planning notes. They show how the CHS sought to organize itself, select candidates for commissioners, and research literature on human security. </p><p>
Other documents in the series provide evidence of Ogata's involvement with organizations and projects focusing on subjects such as refugees, children, and assistance to Afghanistan. Ogata served as Special Representative of the Prime Minister of Japan on Afghanistan Assistance during this time period. Much of Ogata's communication with scholars, professionals, and organizations concerned with international peace and governance was handled by Megumi Nakamura, her Personal Assistant based in Tokyo, Japan and by Claudia Fletcher, her Executive Administrative Assistant based in New York, New York. Correspondence, purchase records, and schedules created, maintained, and distributed by Nakamura and Fletcher document the communications Ogata had with different individuals and organizations as well as the meetings and conferences she attended. </p></scopecontent><c id="3c8ac46c764c4cb8c0e2efc87ce0f1d4" level="file"><did><unittitle>Commission on Human Security (CHS) Third Meeting, Stockholm,
