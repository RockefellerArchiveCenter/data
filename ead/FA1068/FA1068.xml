<p>The Rockefeller University, established in 1901 by John D. Rockefeller as The Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, was the first institution in the United States devoted solely to biomedical research. The earliest work was carried on through grants-in-aid to researchers in various American, and a few European, laboratories, but that program was phased out after the Institute's own laboratories were opened on its New York City campus in 1906. In 1954, the Institute became part of the University of the State of New York and acquired the right to confer graduate degrees, awarding its first Ph.D. in 1959. The Institute became The Rockefeller University in 1965.</p><p>The University archives delineate the growth of research programs which from the beginning were aimed at developing fundamental knowledge of disease and physiology. Research is carried out in interdisciplinary laboratories headed by leading scientists, who were known for more than fifty years as Members of the Institute and subsequently as Professors. A hospital was opened in 1910 and has remained an integral part of the research program. </p><p>Many Rockefeller University scientists have been recognized for excellence in their respective fields. As of 2014, 24 Rockefeller University associated scientists have received Nobel Prizes, fourteen scientists have been awarded the National Medal of Science, and 21 have received the Albert Lasker Medical Research Award.</p>  </bioghist>

<p>The RU index cards were created as a reference tool in the 1960s by the Rockefeller University library staff initially in charge of the RU Archives.  The cards included name, subject, and archival collection headings.  Two identical sets of catalog cards were maintained, one at the Archives Office, on campus and the other at the Rockefeller Archive Center, to which most of the RU Archives' records were transferred, starting in the mid-1970s.  The RU index card catalog was maintained until 1990, at which time all collection description was created in standard archival finding aids.  Despite the end date for this catalog system, the item-level description of the materials in the RU Archives makes it an important reference resource for scholars.</p>  </custodhist>
