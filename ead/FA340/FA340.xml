    <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
<p>Nelson Aldrich Rockefeller was born on July 8, 1908, in Bar Harbor, Maine, the third child of John Davison Rockefeller, Jr., and Abby Aldrich Rockefeller. He graduated from the Lincoln School of Teachers College at Columbia University in New York City in 1926. Mr. Rockefeller attended Dartmouth College where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa, graduating cum laude in 1930 with an A.B. degree in economics.</p><p>After college, Mr. Rockefeller was active in family enterprises, including real estate, banking, and family philanthropies. His major business interests in time became focused on Rockefeller Center and Latin America. In 1938, he became the president of Rockefeller Center.</p><p>In 1935, because of his interest in national affairs and his desire to learn about U.S. business abroad, Mr. Rockefeller became a director of Creole Petroleum Company, the Venezuelan subsidiary of Standard Oil of New Jersey. This association led eventually to his deep, life-long interest in Latin America. He made extensive visits to Latin America in 1937 and 1939 to study economic, social, and political conditions. He resigned his directorship in the Creole Petroleum Company in 1940.</p><p>In 1940, Mr. Rockefeller and his four brothers organized the Rockefeller Brothers Fund to carry out a broad range of philanthropic activities.</p><p>Throughout his life Mr. Rockefeller was an avid supporter of the arts. He served as a trustee, treasurer, president, and chair of the board of the Museum of Modern Art, which was cofounded by his mother. In 1954, he founded the Museum of Primitive Art, which collected of indigenous art of the Americas, Africa, Oceania, and early Asia and Europe.</p><p>After his 1939 visit to Latin America, Mr. Rockefeller prepared a memorandum for President Franklin D. Roosevelt outlining his deep concern over Nazi influence and penetration into that part of the world. In the memo he recommended a U.S. program of cooperation with the nations of the western hemisphere to achieve better relations among these nations and to help raise their standards of living. Largely as a result of this memo, President Roosevelt asked Mr. Rockefeller in August of 1940 to initiate and head a new program ultimately known as the Office of Inter-American Affairs. Mr. Rockefeller served as Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs, his first full-time position in public service.</p><p>Mr. Rockefeller served in this position until December 1944, when President Roosevelt appointed him Assistant Secretary of State for American Republic Affairs. In this post, Mr. Rockefeller initiated the Inter-American Conference on Problems of War and Peace in Mexico City in February of 1945. It resulted in the Act of Chapultepec, which provided the framework for economic, social, and defense cooperation among the nations of the western hemisphere and set the principle that an attack on one of these nations would be regarded as an attack on all and jointly resisted.</p><p>Mr. Rockefeller signed the Act of Chapultepec on behalf of the United States. He also attended the United Nations Conference on International Organization in San Francisco in 1945. At the conference, there was considerable opposition to the idea of permitting, within the UN Charter, the formation of regional pacts such as the Act of Chapultepec. Mr. Rockefeller, who believed that the inclusion was essential, especially to U.S. policy in Latin America, successfully argued the need for regional pacts within the framework of the United Nations. The importance of this victory was underscored by the subsequent formation of NATO, SEATO, and the Rio Pact.</p><p>During these war-time years, Mr. Rockefeller also served as Chairman of the Inter-American Development Commission, which was established in June 1940 to reorganize and revitalize Latin American economies following the loss of European markets. He was also the U.S. Co-Chairman of the Mexican-American Development Commission to help Mexico emerge as an industrial nation in the transition from war to peace.</p><p>Mr. Rockefeller resigned as Assistant Secretary of State on August 24, 1945.</p><p>Upon his return to private life in New York in 1946, Mr. Rockefeller became chair of the board of Rockefeller Center and undertook a program of physical expansion. Two other initiatives during this period illustrate Mr. Rockefeller's continuing interest in Latin America and international economic development. In July of 1946, the Rockefeller brothers established a philanthropic organization, the American International Association for Economic and Social Development (AIA). AIA financed nonprofit projects to ameliorate health, educational, agricultural, and other social problems in the poorer areas of Latin America. Nelson Rockefeller served as President from July 1946 to June 1953 and from January 1957 to December 1958. In 1947, he organized the International Basic Economy Corporation (IBEC), a business corporation to help raise living standards in foreign countries through new economic enterprises. In its early years, IBEC concentrated on enterprises in Latin America but later expanded its activities to other regions. Mr. Rockefeller served as IBEC President from January 1947 to June 1953 and from January 1956 to December 1958.</p><p>In his inaugural address in January 1949, President Harry S. Truman announced the Point IV program for providing technical assistance to developing nations. This concept was based in part on programs Mr. Rockefeller and his associates had developed through the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs and the private, philanthropic AIA. In November of 1950, President Truman asked Mr. Rockefeller to serve as Chairman of the International Development Advisory Board. The Board was charged with recommending policies for carrying out the Point IV program. The Board's report, entitled "Partners in Progress," provided the basic blueprint for America's foreign assistance program.</p><p>On November 20, 1952, President-elect Dwight D. Eisenhower asked Mr. Rockefeller to serve as Chairman of the President's Advisory Committee on Government Organization, a group created to recommend ways to improve the efficiency of the executive branch of the government. As Chairman of that committee, Mr. Rockefeller recommended 13 reorganization plans to the President, 10 of which were approved by Congress. These plans achieved basic changes in the organization of the Department of Defense, the Department of Agriculture, and the Office of Defense Mobilization, among others. Another of the plans led to the establishment of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. In June 1953, Mr. Rockefeller was appointed Under Secretary of the new department. He was especially active in the department's legislative program, recommending measures that covered an additional ten million people under the Social Security program. He resigned as HEW Under Secretary in 1954 to become Special Assistant to the President for Foreign Affairs.</p><p>While serving as Special Assistant, Mr. Rockefeller played a key role in the development of the "Open Skies" proposal for checking on world armaments through mutual air reconnaissance. He accompanied President Eisenhower to the Geneva Summit Conference in 1955, where the plan was proposed to the world by the President. Mr. Rockefeller resigned as Special Assistant on December 31, 1955.</p><p>Mr. Rockefeller first ran for public office in 1958 and was elected Governor of New York on November 4, defeating incumbent Averill Harriman. He took office January 1, 1959, and was subsequently re-elected Governor three more times, thus becoming the first Governor in the nation's history to be elected to four 4-year terms.</p><p>Nelson Rockefeller's tenure as a public servant in the federal government was a formative period in his life. By the time he left Washington to assume the governorship of New York, he had received a thorough education in the workings of the federal government. His chairmanship of PACGO permitted him to examine every aspect of the executive branch. This and his work in HEW exposed him to a wide variety of domestic issues. He gained experience in initiating legislation, in foreign policy and diplomacy, in domestic and international economics, and in national security and military affairs. In the process he also received an education in national politics and gained a reputation for being an effective and hardworking administrator. Most importantly, these appointments provided him with the opportunity to form the friendships and personal associations that served him throughout his political career.</p><p>Mr. Rockefeller resigned as Governor of New York in December 1973. In August 1974, President Gerald R. Ford nominated him to fill the vacant vice presidency following the resignation of President Richard M. Nixon. Mr. Rockefeller served as Vice President from December 19, 1974, to January 20, 1977. Nelson Rockefeller died on January 26, 1979, in New York City.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
<p>The files in this series were created in the course of acquiring, managing, and disseminating pieces in Nelson A. Rockefeller's extensive art collection.</p><p>For the most part, these are the files of Carol Kinzel Uht, who served as Mr. Rockefeller's full-time curator from December 1949 until her death in 1978. Cynthia Bronson Altman joined the staff in 1971, serving as assistant curator and later as associate curator. Kendall P. Lutkins was responsible for the decorative arts portion of the art collection, including the Chinese pottery and porcelain. After Ms. Uht's death, Ms. Lutkins and Ms. Altman assumed most of these responsibilities and were also responsible for the eventual dissemination of Mr. Rockefeller's art collection in accordance with his will.</p><p>The documentation begins with some of Mr. Rockefeller's earliest purchases in 1931 and ends with his death in January 1979. A card file facilitates access to the various correspondence files and offers an abstract of the provenance, management, and disposition of each work of art.</p>  </scopecontent>

Both document the acquisition, provenance, condition, cataloging, placement, and conservation of works of art. The alphabetical file primarily concerns pieces of modern art with documentation for each piece filed under the artist's name. The alphabetical file also contains correspondence with dealers, conservators, galleries, museums, and other institutions regarding the acquisition, care, and loan of works of art. The numeric file is an arrangement created by Mrs. Uht to categorize nonmodern art. Works of art were first designated by geographic region and then arranged by accession number. The index for this file is in Appendix A. Works of art documented within this series were in Mr. Rockefeller's collection at the time of his death in January 1979. Files pertaining to works of art that were no longer in the collection were transferred to the canceled art files (Subseries 6). The NAR art files were periodically sent to the Rockefeller family archives and were maintained there for several years.

It documents broad issues concerning the management of the collection that are not necessarily associated with one particular piece of art. It includes correspondence with galleries, auction houses, dealers, and museums regarding art work being lent, bought, or sold. There is also internal correspondence regarding the placement and maintenance of works of art owned by other members of the Rockefeller family.</p><p>Included in this subseries are files on art works belonging to Mr. Rockefeller that were damaged or destroyed in the March 1961 fire at the Executive mansion in Albany (filed under "Albany"). His support of the Museum of Modern Art and the Museum of Primitive Art is also evident here. There are also files on the exhibition of portions of his collection at MoMA in 1969.</p></scopecontent><c id="b2f965b27ec544e79d9d3d37edbec37e" level="file"><did><unittitle>AAA Gallery - Acquavella Galleries</unittitle><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="5b697da0181d2c0f592eae836bc22e25" label="Mixed Materials [A0000000042500]" type="box">1</container><container id="15ed6a17de171fcee1172522ef69c30e" parent="5b697da0181d2c0f592eae836bc22e25" type="folder">1</container></did><scopecontent id="be2dbf485ace0cf192931724fb779ca8"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>General correspondence and memoranda concerning loans of NAR artworks, possible purchases and inquiries and comments from the public.</p><p>AAA Gallery Aach, Herb Aaltonen, Waino Aura, Warren Aanori, Don Abbott, Kate Abel, Josef Abell, Mrs. William S.

The various photo inventories comprise 4 different sets and were created after Mr. Rockefeller left the Vice Presidency in January 1977. Sets 1 and 2 were located in Mr. Rockefeller's office for easy access.</p><p>Set 1 is a complete photo inventory of the art collection in 1977. Other sets focus on Mr. Rockefeller's primitive art collection, which was used to establish the Museum of Primitive Art and later became part of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, as well as his fine arts objects. Set 4 is organized by the location of a work of art within Mr. Rockefeller's various homes. Additionally, there are three bound volumes titled "Canceled Art," which are inventories of works which were no longer part of the collection (see Subseries 6). Also within this subseries are 16 black binders of photocopies of catalog cards on which the Museum of Primitive Art recorded information regarding individual works of art given to it by Mr. Rockefeller. These indicate the origin of the item and other pertinent information regarding the work that the museum found necessary to have.</p></scopecontent><odd id="ce9326ad734901b4f1bd4e441543089b"><head>General note</head><p>A complete list of the collection inventories is available at the Rockefeller Archive Center.

The set begins with photos of contemporary and modern art from the 19th and 20th centuries, which are arranged alphabetically by the artist's last name. Multiple works by the same artist are arranged alphabetically by title or by medium.</p><p>The set continues with photos of Rockefeller's nonmodern and primitive art collection from early America, China, Japan, India, Greece, Egypt, and Western Europe, subdivided into geographical sections. Within some sections, the photos are further subdivided by the medium of the art. Each section and subsection is arranged numerically by a two-part inventory number that refers to the geographic region and then to the individual artwork. See Appendix A for the list of definitions of the section numbers.</p></scopecontent><c id="692d758003ec4e1c9b1997422d0a9326" level="file"><did><unittitle>Abe - Alpuy</unittitle><container

4</unittitle></did><scopecontent id="e03acf00ebaf525ef9c98bdf2909aa79"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Set 4 is an extensive photo inventory documenting Nelson Rockefeller's art collection organized by the location of the artwork in Rockefeller's homes and offices in 1977. The set covers a broad spectrum of media, including sculptures, paintings, furniture, and porcelains. Three location subsets have been rehoused from their original green binders for preservation reasons: West 54th Street and 812 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, as well as Foxhall Road in Washington, DC.</p>

<p>The photographs are first organized according to the property where the art was located and then  further divided to reflect the 14 binder volumes in which they were originally housed. The photographs remain in their original order, which seems to reflect a system of categorization created by curator Carol Uht that involves a set of numbers assigned to each photograph. These numbers are recorded on the folder level but, unfortunately, their significance remains ambiguous.</p>

He read art auction catalogs and gallery brochures as commonly as some people read novels. He usually took some with him on his travels, to scan when he had a free moment. Of particular interest are the auction catalogs that are notated by Mr. Rockefeller to indicate which items he was interested in acquiring. The notations, which were directed to Mrs. Uht, include the maximum amount he was willing to pay for each item. Mrs. Uht sometimes reviewed the catalogs before Mr. Rockefeller did and placed paper clips on pages with items that she thought he might want to purchase.</p><p>The exhibit catalogs are primarily from the Museum of Modern Art and the Museum of Primitive Art, both of which he was closely associated with. Mrs. Uht also tried to keep a copy of everything that was published regarding works owned by Mr. Rockefeller, particularly exhibit catalogs that included items borrowed from his collection. There is also about one cubic foot of miscellaneous art books, some in languages other than English.</p><p>There are eight volumes of Library Catalogs, which primarily record the location of each of Mr. Rockefeller's many art books. The last two volumes record the location of etchings and drawings owned by Mr. Rockefeller.</p><p>Finally, there are 23 volumes of appraisals of portions of Mr. Rockefeller's collections conducted annually from 1962 to 1976. This was done by the Fine Arts Valuation Service, headed by Gustave Gilbert. The works included in each volume are arranged alphabetically by artist and then by title. A catalog number is included as well as the value of the work. Some notations were made showing that an item was going to leave the collection (pledged) or had already left the collection (canceled).</p></scopecontent><relatedmaterial id="3aaf010a24b25986130e07fedfc01f80"><head>Related Archival Materials note</head><p>The Museum of Primitive Art books, Museum of Modern Art books, and miscellaneous art books have been included in the Rockefeller Archive Center library card catalog.
