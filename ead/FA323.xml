    <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
<p>The Religious Interests series reflects the Rockefeller family's interest in and contributions to various churches and religious organizations. The files contain correspondence between members of the family and the family office, as well as officials and members of the various religious institutions. In some cases, the files include financial information on the appealing institutions. The miscellaneous files generally contain unsolicited appeals for donations. The series illustrates family contributions to religious organizations up to 1962. The contributions were made to a wide spectrum of organizations and activities, such as missionary movements, interdenominational cooperation, and religious education.</p><p>Except for John D. Rockefeller, Jr., these files do not provide information on the personal religious convictions of members of the Rockefeller family. John D. Rockefeller Jr.'s ideas on the Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of Man are well documented. These ideas are essential elements in understanding his continuing impact on religious organizations and thought.</p>  </scopecontent>
