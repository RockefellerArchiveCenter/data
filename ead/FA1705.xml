<p>After the establishment of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting in 1967, the Ford Foundation's Public Broadcasting program was active from 1968-1973. During this period, the Foundation focused on communications policy and programming to supplement private development of public broadcasting. In collaboration with the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, key initiatives were advancing the interconnection of non-commercial television stations throughout the United States, providing funds to National Educational Television (NET) and the Public Broadcasting Laboratory (PBL), working alongside the Federal Communications Commission to discuss regulations for cable television (CATV) systems and the potential for a domestic satellite for broadcasting, and encouraging innovation in programming at the local and regional levels.</p><p>The Foundation provided funds in this area prior to the establishment of the Public Broadcasting Program. The Gaither Report, a 1949 study sent to Ford trustees that guided Foundation initiatives, foresaw an opportunity to support educational programming by remarking that public television could play "a profound role in the general education of youth and have an effect in many instances more powerful than that of our schools themselves." In 1952, the Ford Foundation began providing grants to National Educational Television (NET). Between 1952 and 1963, Ford entities supported NET with roughly $25 million. Throughout the 1960s, Ford support to NET averaged $6-7 million annually From 1952-1961 the Ford Foundation made approximately $3.5 million in grants to 37 community organizations for the establishment of public television stations. The Ford Foundation first made grants in the field of media and communications in 1951, when funds were provided to the Radio and Television Workshop for the production of broadcast programming. Through 1977, the foundation gave over $295 million to develop public television stations, networks and content.</p>  </bioghist>
