    <head>Conditions Governing Access</head>
<p>Records more than 20 years old are open for research with select materials restricted as noted. Brittle or damaged items are available at the discretion of RAC. Researchers interested in accessing digital media (floppy disks, CDs, DVDs, etc.) or audiovisual material (audio cassettes, VHS, etc.) in this collection must use an access surrogate. The original items may not be accessed because of preservation concerns. To request an access surrogate be made, or if you are unsure if there is an access surrogate, please contact an archivist.</p>  </accessrestrict>

    <head>Arrangement</head>
<p>The Rockefeller Foundation Project Files, RG 1, are subdivided into sub groups based on when the material was transferrred to the RAC. The subgroups open for research currently span SG 1.1 through SG 1.26 (received by the RAC in 2000).</p><p>These sub groups are then further arranged in series (primarily by country/geographic area), and subseries (alphabetically, with each assigned letter signifying a subject/program). </p><p>An Alphabetical Guide to Country Codes in the Rockefeller Foundation Archives is available at the RAC. This guide details series established in RG 1 (SG 1.1, 1.2, 1.3), RG 2, RG 5 and portions of RG 6 (SG 6.1 and 6.2.).</p><p>Beginning around 1989 Rockefeller Foundation records management practices began a long process of evolving away from the established series and subseries structure, and began to identify and organize records according to Program (or Program Code). By 1999 the overwhelming majority of records were no longer designated by traditional series, with the exception of Series 120 Bellagio Study and Conference Center.</p><p>Select Programs from the late 1980s-1990s include:</p><p>Assets and Capacities (AC).
Arts and Humanities (AH).
African Initiatives (AI).
Agricultural Sciences (AS).
Creativity and Culture (CC).
