<p>The Ford Foundation was chartered by Henry and Edsel Ford in 1936 "to receive and administer funds for scientific, educational and charitable purposes, all for the public welfare", and initially served the Ford family's charitable interests in the Detroit area. Following the deaths of Edsel Ford (1943) and Henry Ford (1947), the Foundation was propelled to the forefront of philanthropy as the largest American foundation in terms of both endowment and yearly expenditures, and with an international scope to its major program areas. </p><p>
During the Foundation's first twenty years its major programs were in international economic development, primary and higher education, educational and public broadcasting, behavioral sciences, civil liberties, urban development, fine arts and the humanities. The Ford Foundation also partnered with the Rockefeller Foundation in supporting agricultural development in South America, Africa, and Southeast Asia. Since the 1970s, the Foundation has also pioneered programs in women's rights, energy policy, micro-financing in under-developed countries, establishing human rights groups, and improving international HIV/AIDS education. </p>  </bioghist>

It is chiefly comprised of correspondence and internal Ford memos that Marks sent to human rights organizations and Ford staff members. However, it also contains some correspondence that was addressed to Marks by the aforementioned entities as well as other kinds of documents such as meeting agendas and project proposals. Marks frequently corresponded with Human Rights and Governance Program Director Shepard Forman as well as with organizations like the International League for Human Rights, the International Human Rights Law Group, and the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights. Correspondence discusses subjects like measures against torture, the rights of minorities, women and indigenous peoples, democracy, and international human rights law.</p><p>
Original order was maintained and files represent how Marks compiled the materials. Researchers will therefore see the majority of correspondence in reverse chronological order of creation date.</p></scopecontent><c id="6f136a328f4119e9db456a416ec7590f" level="file"><did><unittitle>Chronological file</unittitle><unitdate normal="1987/1987">1987</unitdate><langmaterial id="c9a7b7c9fe88aa5a25831807b4d88432">Materials predominately in English.
