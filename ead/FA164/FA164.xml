      <p>Donald Redfield Griffin was born on August 3, 1915 in Southampton New York. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in 1938, a Masters in 1940, and a Ph. D in 1942, all from Harvard. While still an undergrad, Dr. Griffin began an extensive project banding bats in the American North East. Part of this project was based in Woods Hole, Massachusetts where his uncle, Alfred Redfield, worked. Dr. Griffin banded bats into the 1950s’ and the results of the banding led to new discoveries in Bat longevity, migration, and colony sizes.</p>
      <p>The first experiments of his regarding echolocation were also started while he was an undergrad at Harvard. Dr. Griffin and another student Robert Galambos first herd the ultrasonic chirps of bats with help from physics Professor George W. Pierce. Dr. Griffin worked as a Junior Fellow and teaching assistant in Biology at Harvard after graduation and became a research associate in the Psycho-Acoustic, Fatigue, and Biological Laboratories.</p>
      <p>During World War II, Dr. Griffin worked under US government contracts researching communication equipment and cold weather clothing improvements for the Armed Forces. Harvard’s Fatigue Lab was used at this time to analyze the properties of clothing, especially for pilots in the Air Force.</p>
      <p>In 1946 Dr. Griffin joined the faculty at Cornell University Department of Zoology, progressing from assistant professor to full professor. Both the Air Force and the Navy supported his research in the late 1940’s into the 1950’s pertaining to bird migration patterns and the use of radioactive isotopes in bird tracking. This research was conducted at Point Barrow and Fairbanks, Alaska. The US Air Force also supported his research during the mid 1950s’ in Alaska pertaining to insulating properties of small mammal’s fur.</p>
      <p>In 1953 Dr. Griffin returned to Harvard as a professor. He served as Chairman of the Biology department between 1962 and 1965. At Harvard he resumed his studies into bats use of echolocation, the word coined by him, to determine the size, distance, and location of objects including prey. He also began studying birds homing abilities here, going so far as leaning how to fly a plan to track the birds.</p>
      <p>He then moved to Rockefeller University as a professor and became a fellow of the New York Zoological Society. Between 1965 and 1969 he served as director of the Institute for Research in Animal Behavior. During the late 1960’s and 1970’s Dr. Griffin returned to studying bird’s ability to navigation in clouds when neither the sky nor ground was visible to them for orientation. The US National Science Foundation sponsored a expedition to Queensland, Australia in 1980 for the study of sensory physiology and perception in Bats and Cave Swiftlets. Dr. Griffin retired from Rockefeller University in 1986. His research and analysis of animal behavior established his argument that animals possess the ability to think and are not just impulsive automatons radically changed how scientist viewed and studied animals.</p>
      <p>Dr. Griffin was associated with many professional organizations including: National Academy of Sciences, American Philosophical Society, American Academy of Arts and Sciences, American Society of Mammalogists, American Physiological Society, and American Ornithologists Union.</p>
      <p>Dr. Griffin published many articles and books. His most famous include: Listening in the Dark (1958) for which he was awarded the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal of the National Academy of Sciences, Echoes of Bats and Men (1959), Animal Structure and Function (1962), Bird Migration (1964) for which he won the Phi Beta Kappa Science Prize, The Question of Animal Awareness: Evolutionary Continuity of Mental Experience (1976 and a revised edition in1981).</p>
      <p>He was married twice, first to Ruth Castle and later to Joycelyn Crane. He has three children Janet Abbott, Margaret Griffin, and John Griffin. Donald Griffin died November 7, 2003 in Lexington, Massachusetts.</p>
      <p>Prizes and Honors Elliot Medal of the National Academy of Sciences for Listening in the Dark, 1961, Phi Beta Kappa Science Prize for Bird Migration, 1966, Honorary D. Sc., Ripon College 1966, Honorary D. Sc, Universität Tübingen, Tübingen, FRG 1988</p>
