<p>The International Education Board was incorporated January 12, 1923, in the state of Virginia. Its purpose was to promote education, institutional or otherwise, throughout the world and as such was a complement to the General Education Board which functioned in the United States. Wickliffe Rose resigned from the International Health Board in 1923 to become director of both boards. At his retirement in 1928, the International Education Board discontinued its active program.</p><p>The International Education Board promoted the advancement of education through grants to universities and through a multitude of fellowships to individuals. It sponsored the strengthening of disciplines with such grants as those to develop Mount Palomar and traveling professorships and fellowships. While the main fields of the board were the physical and natural sciences and agriculture, some appropriations were made in the humanities and social sciences as to the American Academy in Rome, the Oriental Institute in Chicago and the New York State Colonization Society for the Booker Washington Agricultural and Industrial Institute of Liberia.</p><p>The Board terminated its activities on December 31, 1938.</p><p>A history, "Education on an International Scale," was written by George Gray.</p><p>The International Education Board records cover the period from 1923 to 1960.</p>  </bioghist>
