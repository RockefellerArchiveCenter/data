    <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
<p>Blanchette Ferry Hooker was born in New York City on October 2, 1909, the youngest of the four daughters of Blanche Ferry, an heiress to the Ferry seed fortune, and Elon Huntington Hooker, an engineer and president of the Hooker Electro-Chemical Company. From 1918 through 1927 she was a student at Miss Chapin's School for Girls. During her childhood Blanchette acquired a nickname, "Hookie," by which she would be known to family and close friends throughout her life.</p><p>In 1927 she began her studies at Vassar College, which culminated with an A.B. degree in music in 1931. Blanchette was president of her senior class and was voted the "Most Perfect Lady" as well as the "Most Respected" member of her graduating class. A year later (November 11, 1932) she married John D. Rockefeller 3rd, the eldest of the five sons of John D. Rockefeller Jr., at the Riverside Church in New York City. Together they raised four children. They maintained principal residences in New York City and at Fieldwood Farm in Mt. Pleasant in Westchester County, New York.</p><p>Blanchette Rockefeller began her life-long involvement in New York City's charitable and civic activities by joining the Community Service Society in 1933 as a member of its Central Council. She was also a trustee of the Brearley School, Vassar College, and The Juilliard School. Mrs. Rockefeller's lengthy affiliation with the Museum of Modern Art began in 1949 with her role as founding chairman of its Junior Council. She served the museum in various capacities (including two terms as president) until her election as President Emeritus in 1987.</p><p>From 1974 to 1980 Mrs. Rockefeller was a member of the National Council on the Humanities. She was appointed to the New York State Council on the Arts in 1979, and was re-appointed in 1981 for a six-year term. In 1985 she was elected to the Board of the Vivian Beaumont Theater. Her memberships included the New York Philharmonic Symphony Society, the English-Speaking Union, the American Federation of Arts, the Riverside Church, and the River Club as well as numerous other leading cultural institutions.</p><p>Mrs. Rockefeller shared many of her husband's philanthropic interests. She was a member of the Asia Society, which he founded, as well as a member of both the Society's Gallery Advisory Committee and the Friends of Asia House. She was also a member of the Gallery Committee of the Japan Society and of the American Advisory Committee to the Japan Foundation. Their deep interest in Asia and Asian art had begun in the early 1950s with Mr. Rockefeller's appointment to John Foster Dulles' Peace Treaty Mission to Japan, a country that would become almost a second home to the couple.</p><p>Throughout their marriage, Blanchette and John D. Rockefeller 3rd devoted a great deal of time to art collecting. They gradually assembled world-class collections of Asian and American art which were donated to the Asia Society and to San Francisco's DeYoung Museum respectively.</p><p>Blanchette Ferry Hooker Rockefeller died from Alzheimer's disease complicated by pneumonia on November 29, 1992, at her home in Mt. Pleasant. She was 83 years old. A memorial service was held at the Riverside Church in New York City on December 4 of that year.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
<p>The papers of Blanchette Ferry Hooker Rockefeller (1909-1992), which span the years 1884-1994, document the various roles Mrs. John D. Rockefeller 3rd played in her lifetime, including that of daughter, wife, mother, daughter-in-law, aunt, friend, philanthropist, art collector, and political fundraiser. The papers contain her personal and family correspondence, photographs, and memorabilia as well as the records generated by her philanthropic activities. They provide information on her ancestors; education; relationships with family members, friends, and associates; travels; and on her social concerns and benevolences. While the bulk of the papers deals with Mrs. Rockefeller's lifetime, some items relating to her forebears predate her birth. Due to shared interests and activities in many areas, Mrs. Rockefeller's papers parallel and complement the papers of her husband, John D. Rockefeller 3rd, which are also housed at the Rockefeller Archive Center and which are open to researchers.</p>  </scopecontent>

Mrs. Rockefeller, a descendant of Massachusetts Colony pastor Thomas Hooker, was the daughter of Elon H. Hooker, a civil engineer and founder of the Hooker Electrochemical Company who was active in Republican politics. A friend of and advisor to Theodore Roosevelt, Elon Hooker was a candidate for the Republican nomination for the governorship of New York in 1920. He was also chairman of the Committee on Internal Trade and Improvements of the Chamber of Commerce of the State of New York. This series contains speeches and articles by Hooker as well as ephemera from his gubernatorial campaign. Material on the history of the electrochemical company will also be found here (box 8).</p><p>Blanchette's mother, Blanche Ferry, was the daughter of the founder of the Detroit-based seed company, D. M. Ferry and Co., a predecessor of the Ferry-Morse Seed Co. (Information on the seed companies, including an 1896 brochure entitled "Extra Early Blanche Ferry Sweet Pea," can be found in box 1 of this series.) Blanche Ferry's wedding to Elon Hooker in 1901 is documented here as well as her role as the mother of four daughters: Barbara, Adelaide, Helen, and Blanchette. Of special interest in these files are the letters written by and about Blanchette during her childhood (box 4). (Note that letters written to Blanche Ferry Hooker upon the engagement and wedding of her daughter Blanchette to John D. Rockefeller 3rd will be found in boxes 26, 50, and 51 of the Subject Series.)</p><p>Additionally, this series provides ample evidence of the deep affection Mrs. Rockefeller had for her sisters and their families. She tended to the needs of various family members, including those of her never-married oldest sister, Barbara, who suffered from mental illness. Mrs. Rockefeller's sister Adelaide married the best-selling novelist John P. Marquand. Her sister Helen, an artist and poet, was first married to Ernest O'Malley, a prominent figure in the Irish Republican movement who began his connection with the cause at the age of 18 during the Easter Week uprising of 1916. Throughout her life Mrs. Rockefeller corresponded with and remained close and attentive to her sisters, nieces, and nephews.</p></scopecontent><c id="aabba3bc24254882913cd62ff7a1e822" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ferry Family - Coat of Arms</unittitle><container id="fe3003fc1bca5ea6550dd7433c95af36" label="mixed materials [110446.1.318]" type="box">1</container><container id="7f404e3f3e5c4c38d17cf757f252ded4" parent="fe3003fc1bca5ea6550dd7433c95af36" type="folder">1</container></did></c><c id="f565326e59a74398ac7b219a79554e3b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ferry Family - Genealogical Material</unittitle><container id="25934aa426ec48b9c744a047202d8153" label="mixed materials [110446.1.318]" type="box">1</container><container id="6d4e8cf3a312798260fb97380ace9e28" parent="25934aa426ec48b9c744a047202d8153" type="folder">2</container></did></c><c id="4a7fc828f11844f2bb8cf38b4311698e" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ferry Family - Historical Study</unittitle><unitdate normal="1984/1984" type="inclusive">1984</unitdate><container id="d568aa9681cacbef89bd1b4f4ce6e6c4" label="mixed materials [110446.1.318]" type="box">1</container><container id="85b8a4de2cc95619aa898b7093b120b2" parent="d568aa9681cacbef89bd1b4f4ce6e6c4" type="folder">3</container></did></c><c id="d95bf23e764d473db96aa60f32778229" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ferry Family - Coonley, Queene Ferry</unittitle><unitdate normal="1901/1962" type="inclusive">1901-1962</unitdate><container id="bddab5a734c1ac663bb3210c0f9f6694" label="mixed materials [110446.1.318]" type="box">1</container><container id="1d9858e8b4eed86e60157585041fc9c9" parent="bddab5a734c1ac663bb3210c0f9f6694" type="folder">4</container></did></c><c id="21fd2104bae945ab98f341af2006d0ad" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ferry Family - Faulkner, Elizabeth Ferry Coonley</unittitle><unitdate normal="1979/1990" type="inclusive">1979-1990</unitdate><container id="030891c91ddb94fab1069ea39d0603fd" label="mixed materials [110446.1.318]" type="box">1</container><container id="a533fc0486d7673cab8291b88d0496c4" parent="030891c91ddb94fab1069ea39d0603fd" type="folder">5</container></did></c><c id="e2e2f15707ea4cbcbdff5b94852fdf24" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ferry Family - Ferry, Dexter Mason and Descendants</unittitle><unitdate normal="1898/1987" type="inclusive">1898-1987</unitdate><container id="346f48736beac193a04b5ca5be7345c1" label="mixed materials [110446.1.318]" type="box">1</container><container id="3e196db6c1e741d5af9afe4e0daa20e8" parent="346f48736beac193a04b5ca5be7345c1" type="folder">6</container></did></c><c id="e6467b6e791a4307b490aa407ed449f8" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ferry Family - Ferry, Dexter Mason - "86 Years and the Seed Company in Detroit"</unittitle><unitdate normal="1942/1942" type="inclusive">1942</unitdate><container id="e92a3e678790f9076a085445d9e1ea22" label="mixed materials [110446.1.318]" type="box">1</container><container id="499a19d242abea9fd49ac8bded75bb50" parent="e92a3e678790f9076a085445d9e1ea22" type="folder">7</container></did></c><c id="7ec3f66f1c9d48efa1d6184eff41c669" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ferry Family - Ferry, Dexter</unittitle><unitdate normal="1972/1992" type="inclusive">1972-1992</unitdate><container id="dcd5afa6f70e4c461459d80414f9f302" label="mixed materials [110446.1.318]" type="box">1</container><container id="a36ed60091dbeff6ad701399c849e34f" parent="dcd5afa6f70e4c461459d80414f9f302" type="folder">8</container></did></c><c id="2608774f7e3945449d65731169e5a97b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ferry Family - Ferry, Edith</unittitle><unitdate normal="1884/1990" type="inclusive">1884-1990</unitdate><container id="eefa3a81219ec4ee8a2f68ab3c2058eb" label="mixed materials [110446.1.318]" type="box">1</container><container id="c2f7d9bbbc4ad58fe7ae7b65ae1e157b" parent="eefa3a81219ec4ee8a2f68ab3c2058eb" type="folder">9</container></did></c><c id="e8dd92f9aa5d46da8644040153476256" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ferry Family - Ferry, Edith (Hooper)</unittitle><unitdate normal="1987/1987" type="inclusive">1987</unitdate><container id="a1aefc1b41e80599ad616b09ad00cd99" label="mixed materials [110446.1.318]" type="box">1</container><container id="638e6166777f7aa1d4933d3cb1cda71b" parent="a1aefc1b41e80599ad616b09ad00cd99" type="folder">10</container></did></c><c id="563cf8e3d41d4ec78c06bdc2199a1986" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ferry Family - Ferry, Jean (Davis)</unittitle><unitdate normal="1979/1983" type="inclusive">1979, 1983</unitdate><container id="f5124099cca89f3c7a315fe7b9fa309f" label="mixed materials [110446.1.318]" type="box">1</container><container id="32793f411150947bf1dd739b5424ade2" parent="f5124099cca89f3c7a315fe7b9fa309f" type="folder">11</container></did></c><c id="ad1a31e798324383b1055fded44009ae" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ferry Family - Ferry, W.

Her personal correspondence, which was maintained alphabetically, will also be found in this series (boxes 40 and 41). Of special note is a scrapbook containing photographs, invitations, brochures, newspaper clippings, and other ephemera and memorabilia documenting Mrs. Rockefeller's life prior to her engagement. (The scrapbook was separated from this series and placed in the Photographs series.) Also of interest are the files relating to her engagement (box 26) and wedding (boxes 50 through 52) to John D. Rockefeller 3rd. A letter and a drawing from Violet Oakley, a popular illustrator, muralist, and social activist, are part of the wedding files. Oakley, a friend of the Hooker family and a leading proponent of the League of Nations, presented a pen-and-ink drawing to the couple upon the occasion of their marriage (separated to Photographs series.)</p><p>Also of a personal nature is the correspondence between Blanchette and John D. Rockefeller 3rd and members of the Rowntree family in England (boxes 43 and 44). Mr. and Mrs. Rockefeller agreed in 1940 to take Benjamin and David, two of the young sons of Peter and Bessie Rowntree, into their home until it was deemed safe for the boys to return to war-ravaged England. For four years the boys lived with the Rockefeller family. The letters offer insights into life on both sides of the Atlantic during World War II.</p><p>The balance of the papers in this series reflects Mrs. Rockefeller's social concerns and philanthropic endeavors. Shortly after her marriage in 1932, Mrs. Rockefeller began her involvement in charitable and civic activities by joining the Central Council of the Community Service Society (see box 24). Throughout her marriage (and particularly after her children were grown), Mrs. Rockefeller served on committees and as a board member for a number of organizations as well as on a variety of governmental commissions and panels. Though numerous, Mrs. Rockefeller's involvement with these organizations and institutions was never casual. For example, in a November 1939 letter to the National Board of the YMCA (box 52) she gave a lengthy and thoughtful enumeration of her reasons for resigning from the board. Her efforts would be whole-hearted or not at all.

Rockefeller, asked her to assist with the formation of a Junior Council which he hoped would attract young, talented committee and board members to the museum. Mrs. Rockefeller served as the first chair of the Junior Council. After World War II she helped form the International Council whose members were involved in the planning and financing of international exhibitions. In 1953 she was named a trustee of MoMA and she served continuously from that year until her retirement in 1987. During that time Mrs. Rockefeller twice served as president (1959-1962, 1972-1985) and was elected chairman of the Board in 1985. During her second tenure as president, MoMA successfully undertook a fundraising campaign, substantially increased exhibit and curatorial space, and added significantly to its collection of modern and contemporary art. These files are revelatory of Mrs. Rockefeller's very active role in many aspects of the museum's operation, including fundraising. Her involvement is evident in the hand-written notes generated by her to committee chairs and to donors and potential donors in her capacity as a "lay administrator." Documented here is the major fundraising event for the museum's 50th anniversary as well as files relating to the controversial issue of selling the air rights of the museum to an outside developer.</p></scopecontent><relatedmaterial id="88b3303d212afb3f78d65dcea4836afb"><head>Related Archival Materials note</head><p>An oral history interview done for the Archives of American Art in 1970, in which Mrs. Rockefeller discusses her association with the MoMA, can be found in the Subject Series (box 16).</p></relatedmaterial><c id="6d89b8bdd4ca4b0dba65a7db87a4f8de" level="file"><did><unittitle>Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Sculpture Garden</unittitle><unitdate normal="1991/1992" type="inclusive">1991-1992</unitdate><container id="05dd72bcfd782f9c9f621a46278619df" label="mixed materials [110874.53.318]" type="box">53</container><container id="f97a6d23ea979a37c66551519d30bcf7" parent="05dd72bcfd782f9c9f621a46278619df" type="folder">406</container></did></c><c id="4994796b9fb14b30978f2638720b5d75" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ad Hoc Committee on Honoring Donors</unittitle><unitdate normal="1959/1984" type="inclusive">1959-1968, 1984</unitdate><container id="aa1bead2312f6f3684752a9b288a05e0" label="mixed materials [110874.53.318]" type="box">53</container><container id="af032fff5859924056d376de1c2d549b" parent="aa1bead2312f6f3684752a9b288a05e0" type="folder">407</container></did></c><c id="127b0a20729f48f0bad56d3ef94b6d8e" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ad Hoc Committee on Honoring Donors</unittitle><unitdate normal="1959/1984" type="inclusive">1959-1968, 1984</unitdate><container id="df4a2892d426dc020501ecf0e032663a" label="mixed materials [110874.53.318]" type="box">53</container><container id="232cb7f1c6c5ad7a025d66a16c8d62b3" parent="df4a2892d426dc020501ecf0e032663a" type="folder">408</container></did></c><c id="2a64130b019a404a8f9ffb3b6e211c01" level="file"><did><unittitle>Architecture and Design</unittitle><unitdate normal="1963/1989" type="inclusive">1963-1989</unitdate><container id="a6a3aeea7e5b87612c24fe12ce3b8258" label="mixed materials [110874.53.318]" type="box">53</container><container id="b8f457a78cbc9526f5cae5e55f7cef0a" parent="a6a3aeea7e5b87612c24fe12ce3b8258" type="folder">409</container></did></c><c id="46d806d586bf461d853aca434173f405" level="file"><did><unittitle>Barr, Alfred H.</unittitle><unitdate normal="1975/1987" type="inclusive">1975-1987</unitdate><container id="7aebebf1a86aa95c654002bb9a39a336" label="mixed materials [110874.53.318]" type="box">53</container><container id="755af67fc28f9dbd2d61599cff551d07" parent="7aebebf1a86aa95c654002bb9a39a336" type="folder">410</container></did></c><c id="78f9bf7c4f164577a6fc815d0e6d5286" level="file"><did><unittitle>Board of Trustees -
