      <abstract id="aspace_b2d0331269d081e7738f25774961a1dd">The Peace and Social Justice Program was established in 1996 to help improve government performance and accountability, foster a thriving independent civil society, and promote human rights. It had two global units: Governance and Civil Society (GCS), and Human Rights. Michael Edwards, a leading expert on civil society, philanthropy and social change with more than two decades of experience working in international relief and development NGOs, served as Director of Governance and Civil Society from 1999 to 2008. The Office Files of Michael Edwards span from 1999 to 2003 and consist of email, memoranda, proposals, meeting agenda books, discussion papers, and reports. The records have been arranged into two series: program management files and meeting files. The program management files contain information about the work of GCS Deputy Director Marcia Smith and Program Officers Julius Ihonvbere and Srilatha Batliwala. These files include email and attachments of papers, proposals and other documents on such topics as GCS initiatives, constitutionalism in Eastern and Central Africa, and transnational civil society. The meeting files hold materials documenting Ford Foundation Officers Meetings and the 2003 GCS Global Meeting in Hanoi, Vietnam.</abstract>

      <head>Organizational History</head>
      <p>When Susan Berresford became President of the Foundation in 1996, she established a new program structure consisting of three large thematic programs. Peace and Social Justice was one of these three programs. It was established to help improve government performance and accountability, foster a thriving independent civil society, and promote human rights. It was comprised of two global units: Governance and Civil Society, and Human Rights. In 2009, Peace and Social Justice became the Democracy, Rights and Justice Program.</p>
      <p>The Governance and Civil Society unit continued much of the work of the former Governance and Public Policy unit. Its goal, according to the Ford Foundation Annual Report for 1996, was to “stimulate new approaches to designing and implementing public policies, and enhance the role of civic organizations, particularly philanthropies, in promoting democratic values.”</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
      <p>The Office Files of Michael Edwards span, from 1999 to 2003, his tenure as Director of Governance and Civil Society. The records have been arranged into two series: Program Management and Meetings.</p>
      <p>The Program Management files document the work of GCS Deputy Director Marcia Smith and Program Officers Julius Ihonvbere and Srilatha Batliwala. Ms. Smith’s files describe several programs and initiatives, including the Collaborations that Count, Fund for Community Organizing, Devolution, and Money and Politics Initiatives as well as annotated drafts of initiative statements. Her files also contain an assessment of her experience managing her portfolio on Civic and Political Participation and her exit memorandum.</p>
      <p>Files on Mr. Ihonvbere contain his proposals, work plan, reflection memo, and exit memo relating to the management of his Pluralism and Governance portfolio. Mr. Ihonvbere specialized in the field of constitutionalism. He sought to help nations transitioning from autocracy to democracy with the process of drafting new constitutions. Draft proposals available in his files include one to establish an International Center for Constitutionalism in Lagos, Nigeria. Another proposal requests funds for Mr. Ihonvbere to conduct research, network, and consult for the purpose of building a foundation for establishing a center on constitutionalism. Other files hold reports about his visits to grantees in India, Sri Lanka, the United Kingdom, Nigeria, South Africa, and Zimbabwe. There are also memoranda describing his appointment by Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo as Chairperson of the Committee on the Implementation of the Nigerian Bitumen Project in August 2000. In addition, emails describe possible support for the non-governmental organization Justice Africa’s human rights and democracy work in Eastern and Central Africa, and the Foundation’s policy on regional grants.</p>
      <p>The files for Ms. Batliwala contain memoranda regarding a concept paper about building a transnational civil society and email pertaining to a brainstorming meeting on the concept of an NGO virtual university. Other memoranda describe her concern that her portfolio was too unwieldy for a single program officer to manage and the circumstances prompting her request for an extension of her contract and visa. Also available is her extensive exit memo describing the history and evolution of her portfolio on strengthening civil society and the non-profit sector within the U.S. and globally.</p>
      <p>The second series in the collection holds materials documenting Ford Foundation Officers Meetings and the 2003 GCS Global Meeting in Hanoi, Vietnam. The files for the Officers Meetings contain detailed agenda with lists of recommended grant actions for consideration. Files for the GCS Global Meeting include the program, resumes for lead speakers, and discussion papers for the workshop, “The Changing State: Structure, Regulation and Sovereignty,” held from October 18-20. The GCS meeting files also contain background on the Ford Foundation’s programs in Vietnam and China, and statements assessing the fields of Governance and Civil Society.</p>
