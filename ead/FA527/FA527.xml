<p>Richard Horovitz (1946-1991) was a foundation executive who worked for several years at the Ford Foundation. Horovitz joined the Ford Foundation in 1983 as a Program Officer in its Developing Country Programs. He then became the Foundation's Representative for West Africa and was based at its Dakar, Senegal office. After that assignment, he returned to his position as Program Officer in the Developing Country Programs and was based at the New York City office.</p><p>In 1989, Horovitz became Executive Director of the Panos Institute. He served in that position until the time of his death in 1991. Horovitz died from AIDS-related complications. His partner, author and poet Melvin Dixon, died from the same cause one year later. The Institute for International Education (IIE) named the Richard A. Horovitz Fund for Professional Development in his memory. The award is for African artists and scholars in the humanities and the social sciences.</p><p>Horovitz completed his undergraduate education at Middlebury College and earned a master's and doctorate degree from Northwestern University. Prior to joining the Ford Foundation, he had positions with the Peace Corps as a volunteer in the Ivory Coast from 1976 to 1978 and with the University of Abidjan as a visiting lecturer.</p>  </bioghist>
