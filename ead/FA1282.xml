<p>The J. Austin Kerr papers document Dr. Kerr's 40-year career with the Rockefeller Foundation where he studied and implemented methods to control and eradicate yellow fever, malaria, and hookworm disease. During his career, Kerr lived in Paraguay, Brazil, Nigeria, Colombia, Egypt, Italy, India, the Philippines, and the U.S. The collection contains memos, personal and professional correspondence, critiques of institutions, drafts of papers, notes, research reports, photographs, gifts presented to Kerr, and Kerr's manuscript collection. The manuscript collection is comprised of 159 documents cataloged by Kerr that include published papers, memos, drafts, personal correspondence, and reflections on his work. The majority of the materials in series 1 are duplicated in series 2. Kerr annotated many of the documents from 1970-1976 during his retirement.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>John Austin Kerr was born July 15, 1900, in Chicago, Illinois. He received a B.S. from Northwestern University in 1923, and he received an M.D. from Northwestern Medical School in 1924. From 1923 to 1925, he completed an internship at St. Luke's Hospital in Chicago. From July 1925 to June 1926, he conducted epidemiological field studies of hookworm infestations in Alabama and Florida at the Field Training Station of the International Health Board of the Rockefeller Foundation (IHB/RF) in Andalusia, Alabama. This assignment started his long career with the Rockefeller Foundation. From June to September 1926, he worked at the Malaria Field Station of the IHB/RF at Edenton, North Carolina where he studied malaria and malaria control. Starting in October 1926 until March 1928, Kerr worked with Brazil's Yellow Fever Service learning antilarval techniques in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil. From May 1928 to April 1929, Kerr worked in Paraguay on a hookworm control program. From April to June 1929, Kerr worked in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil during the yellow fever epidemic. Following the death of Dr. Paul Lewis from yellow fever in June 1929, Kerr worked at the Yellow Fever Laboratory in Bahia, Brazil. At this time, he contracted yellow fever himself. </p><p>From 1930-1931, he was assigned to the Rockefeller Foundation's Yellow Fever Laboratory in Lagos, Nigeria. In 1932, Kerr married Janet MacLennan. From March to November 1932, he investigated potential yellow fever cases in Colombia. He returned to Brazil from 1933 to 1936 to lead the Bahia Laboratory following the death of Dr. Nelson Davis. From 1936 to 1938, he oversaw construction of a lab in Bogota to investigate yellow fever activity in Colombia. From 1939 to 1943, Kerr was stationed in Brazil again where he worked on yellow fever studies and supervised large scale production of 17D yellow fever vaccines. After a few months at the Virus Laboratory of the California State Health Department, he was appointed to the Rockefeller Foundation Health Commission and as a Consultant to the Secretary of War. From July-November 1945, Kerr was Director of the Gambiae Eradication Service of Egypt. From September 1946 to October 1947, he accepted a Rockefeller Foundation assignment to Sardinia to serve as Superintendent of Ente Regionale per la Lotta Anti-Anofelica in Sardegna (ERLAAS), a temporary government entity created to eradicate Anopheles labranchiae. From 1947 to 1951, Kerr worked at the Virus Laboratories of the Rockefeller Foundation located at the Rockefeller Institute (now University) in New York City. There, he studied the influenza virus and arboviruses and wrote the chapter on Clinical Aspects in Yellow Fever edited by George K. Strode. From 1951-1955, Kerr was the Director of Virus Research Centre in Poona, India. From 1955-1965, he served as Director of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) stationed in Washington, D.C. After 40 years with the Rockefeller Foundation, Kerr retired on March 31, 1965 just prior to his mandatory retirement from the Foundation. </p><p>In March 1965, he was appointed Regional Malaria Advisor for the Far East Region of the Agency for International Development of the U.S. (AID) stationed in Manila, Philippines. In 1966, he was transferred to Washington and discharged from service after critiquing the agency's malaria eradication methods. In 1967, Kerr spent a year as a consultant to the Malaria Eradication Branch of the Pan American Health Organization. There, he translated malariological studies from Portuguese to English. The studies had been conducted in El Salvador by the Epidemiological Study Team of PAHO. In 1968, he was a Guest Scholar at the National Library of Medicine to assist his friend and colleague Fred Soper (sometimes abbreviated FLS) in editing his book, "Selections from the Papers of Fred L. Soper." Kerr lived in Chevy Chase, Maryland until 1986. He died December 12, 1990 in Ossining, New York.</p>  </bioghist>

<p>The J. Austin Kerr papers arrived in several shipments from 1968-1976. George Harrar, president of the Rockefeller Foundation, first contacted J. Austin Kerr about donating his personal papers to the Rockefeller Archive Center in 1967. In May 1968, Kerr donated two memos: 1.) A review of the efficacy of vaccination against yellow fever as applied in 1938 and 1939 in Brazil; and 2.) Further considerations on the results obtained following the use of the "17DD high" substrain of 17D virus as vaccine. </p><p>Archivist Mary Boccaccio followed up with Kerr about donating more of his materials in March 1969. In January 1970, he donated two manuscripts 1.) "Sylvan, or jungle, yellow fever in southern Brazil, 1932-1942;" and 2.) "The eradication of Anopheles gambiae from Egypt." </p><p>In June 1970, Kerr donated a yellow fever manuscript and 20 miscellaneous memos and reports. These materials comprise the first series in the collection. In correspondence from June 1970, he describes his 100+ papers that make up his manuscripts collection. He was still in the process of cataloging the early material at this time. The manuscript materials arrived in five packages in September and October 1974. Series 2 is composed of this material. In 1976, Kerr donated a leather souvenir portfolio and inscribed parchment presented to him in Cagliari, Sardinia.</p><p>This material was originally labelled as Accession 13.</p>  </acqinfo>
