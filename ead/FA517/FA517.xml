The Overseas Training and Research program was established in 1952 as a means of demystifying the cultures and communities overseas and improving the skills of social service professionals serving both in the United States and abroad. The program’s board launched a fellowship to encourage college graduates, graduate students, and young professionals to pursue compelling research projects of cultural, educational, and historic value. The collection includes correspondence concerning the establishment of the Board on Overseas Training and Research, meeting minutes of the Board, reports regarding the development and expansion of the program and the grants offered, and statistical analyses of applicants and recipients of the foreign study fellowships. Gordon Gray, President of the University of North Carolina and former attorney, state senator, and Secretary of the Army, accepted the position of Chairman of the Board on Overseas Training and Research upon the program’s inception in 1952.

      <head>Organizational History</head>
      <p>In March 1952 the Ford Foundation announced the establishment of the Overseas Training and Research program (OTR) in an effort to promote peace, education, and the value of social welfare and to improve the skills of social service professionals serving both in the United States and abroad. The OTR program was designed to strengthen cultural connections between countries and help Americans to better understand the practices and politics of other countries. Such work was crucial according to Paul Hoffman, Director of the Ford Foundation, who wrote in a letter to Gordon Gray, dated March 31, 1952, that “we must find ways to improve our training for international service. And we all felt the need for a comprehensive effort to fill in the gaps in our knowledge concerning so many peoples of the world” (Box 1, Folder 1). Soon thereafter, a board of directors was appointed to oversee the program.</p>
      <p>The Board on Overseas Training and Research established a fellowship for college graduates, graduate students, and young professionals with compelling research projects of cultural, educational, and historic value intended to enhance an “understanding of these areas, to afford advanced training to specialists, and to enable professional men and women to study, work and live” in their country of choice (Ford Foundation press release, March 1952; Box 1, Folder 1). The initial fellowships were directed at projects in Asia, the Near East and the Middle East. During the spring of 1952, the Board actively circulated fellowship applications during the spring of 1952 to universities, corporations, government agencies, charitable foundations, and individuals. More than eighty applicants received funding for research during the first year of the program.</p>
      <p>By 1955, the Overseas Training and Research program had been renamed the International Training and Research program and the board which oversaw the unit became an Advisory Committee. The International Training and Research program merged with several other Foundation programs in 1966 to create the International Division, a single unit comprising all international work undertaken by the Foundation. A reorganization in 1981 included the creation of the Developing Countries Program which continued the work of the former International Division. In 1989, the Developing Countries Program was subdivided, separating work done in Asia, Africa and the Middle East, and Latin America and the Caribbean into distinct program areas.</p>

      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Gordon Gray was born on May 30, 1909 in Baltimore, Maryland. In 1930, Mr. Gray received his bachelor’s degree from the University of North Carolina and, in 1933, graduated from Yale Law School. Mr. Gray worked at a New York law firm until 1935 when he left to practice law in North Carolina. By 1937, he had become the president of the Piedmont Publishing Company, responsible for the publication of the Winston-Salem Journal and the Twin City Sentinel as well as the operations of radio station WSJS.</p>
      <p>Interrupted only by his service in the military, Mr. Gray served as a member of the North Carolina State Senate from 1939 to 1942 and again from 1945 to 1947. During World War II he joined the Headquarters of the Twelfth Army Group abroad. Following his return to North Carolina and second stint as a senator, Mr. Gray was appointed Assistant Secretary of the Army on September 24, 1947 and served in that capacity until May 1949, when he became Under Secretary of the Army. The following month, on June 20, 1949, he was appointed Secretary of the Army. Mr. Gray resigned as Secretary in April 1950 to accept the presidency of the University of North Carolina (then referred to as the Consolidated University of North Carolina). Despite his new position, he remained in Washington, D.C. for a year to serve as a special assistant on issues of foreign economic policy to U.S. President Harry S. Truman.</p>
      <p>In 1952, Mr. Gray accepted the position of Chairman of the Ford Foundation’s newly established Board on Overseas Training and Research. He was instrumental in the early development of the Board and the program, and oversaw the creation of the OTR fellowship program, the refinement of the applicant selection rubric, and the appraisal of and search for activities and opportunities abroad.</p>
      <p>Following his resignation as president of the University of North Carolina in 1955, Mr. Gray returned to government work as the Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs, a position he held from 1955 through 1957. He also served as director of the Office of Defense Mobilization, Special Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, and a member of the President’s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board. Throughout his career, Mr. Gray retained his interests in broadcast and publishing and served as Chairman of the boards of the Piedmont Publishing Company, Triangle Broadcasting Company, and Summit Communications, Inc. He died on November 26, 1982, in Washington, D.C.</p>

          <head>Scope and Contents</head>
          <p>This series consists of the materials distributed at each meeting of the Board on Overseas Training and Research and the resulting minutes. The meeting materials and the minutes were located in separate folders when the collection was accessioned. This original arrangement has been preserved. The files have been arranged chronologically by meeting date. The files of meeting materials precede the files of meeting minutes. One additional folder of meeting materials contains documents distributed during the Conference on Soviet and Slavic Area Studies held on October 9-10, 1953. The Board on Overseas Training and Research organized the conference in an attempt to define existing gaps in area studies, establish additional fellowship opportunities and discuss the Ford Foundation’s role in better preparing Soviet and Slavic studies scholars and public servants.</p>

          <p>This series contains reports and evaluations of the OTR program and is arranged chronologically with two undated reports placed at the end. The reports examine opportunities for international education and service, and include recommendations for the recruitment and selection of applicants, evaluations of submitted research proposals, and suggestions for long-term maintenance of the program. There is also a 1952 progress report on the work of the Division of Overseas Activities, which includes an update on the activities of the OTR program.</p>
