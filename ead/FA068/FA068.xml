      <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
      <p>The papers of Nelson W. Aldrich (1841-1915), statesman, financier, and businessman, span the years 1777 to 1930, with the bulk of the material concentrated in the years 1879 to 1915. The collection is composed primarily of correspondence, printed matter, and material relating to tariff legislation and the National Monetary Commission, supplemented by diaries, notebooks, speeches, research notes, serials, financial papers, and miscellaneous items.</p>
      <p>The collection focuses on Aldrich's 30 years of service as a U.S. Senator from Rhode Island, 1881 to 1911. During this lengthy career, Aldrich rose from the relatively obscure position of junior Senator from a small state to become one of the most influential members of the Senate by the close of the nineteenth century. His elevation to the chairmanship of the powerful Senate Finance Committee in 1899 underscored his national prominence, a fact recognized by successive Presidents until his voluntary retirement in 1911. Aldrich's primary concern as a senator centered on national economic and fiscal policy, particularly tariff and monetary policy. By personal business experience, ideological considerations, and the realities of Rhode Island politics, Aldrich normally exerted his influence on behalf of the protective tariff rates and conservative monetary policies favored by powerful northeastern business interests.</p>
      <p>The Aldrich papers reflect the Senator's deep involvement with national economic policy. Tariff legislation is a recurring theme throughout the correspondence series, particularly during the years of major tariff revision in 1890, 1897, and 1909. The correspondence, mainly incoming mail from businessmen representing a wide range of economic interests, reveals the depth of feeling generated by the prospect of tariff revision and the importance of the issue during these years. The letters also provide an insight into American business practices and the economic views of a large segment of the American business community during this era of rapid industrial expansion. Aldrich's personal attention to the details of rate revision is clearly revealed in the tariff file, while his speeches help document his general attitude toward tariff duties as a source of protection for American industry from foreign competition.</p>
      <p>Aldrich gave considerable attention during his last years in office to the problems of U.S. monetary policy. Following the Panic of 1907, with its accompanying rash of bank failures, he cosponsored the Aldrich-Vreeland Act of 1908, providing for the establishment of a National Monetary Commission to study banking and currency operations at home and abroad and to suggest changes in American practices.</p>
      <p>The National Monetary Commission's correspondence for the years 1908-1912 thoroughly documents its activities and Aldrich's role as chairman. Much of the Commission's correspondence was with bankers, public officials, financial experts, and academicians employed to prepare special studies, translate documents, and collect statistics on financial operations and monetary systems in foreign nations as well as in the United States. Aldrich and other members of the Commission visited England, France, and Germany to consult with experts and collect data, and specialists representing the Commission made similar visits to other nations and reported their findings. Hearings were held in selected American cities to solicit opinions from bankers and other interested parties, while numerous individuals sent unsolicited opinions and plans directly to the Commission. Most of the letters were sent and received by Abram Piatt Andrew, special assistant to the Commission, Arthur B. Shelton, secretary to the Commission, and staff members Charles E. Alden, J. Williar Sheetz, and William A. Slade.</p>
      <p>Aldrich's personal views are reflected in occasional correspondence, speeches delivered to promote monetary reform, and in the final report of the Commission--soon labeled the "Aldrich Plan." The Commission's correspondence is also a rich source of information for students of American financial institutions of the early twentieth century and expounds the views of a small but influential segment of the financial community at this time. The National Monetary Commission file contains most of its publications as well as a sampling of the collected data and related material.</p>
      <p>Soon after the death of Senator Henry B. Anthony in 1884, Aldrich assumed Anthony's former position as the most powerful figure in Rhode Island politics. Letters from numerous state political figures, particularly Henry B. Gardner and Charles R. Brayton, kept the busy Senator abreast of local affairs and at the same time reveal his influence in state political circles. The numerous requests for favors, advice, and patronage further attest to his influence.</p>
      <p>Aldrich's personal affairs and family relations form a relatively small portion of the collection. A short series of letters written to his future wife in 1865-1866 offers a glimpse into his personal relations and plans at this time. Another small group of letters written to Mrs. Aldrich during his first trip abroad in 1872-1873 adds to our knowledge of his family relations and reveals his initial impressions of European society and culture. Scattered letters in the correspondence series and the financial papers allow a brief insight into his extensive financial ventures, particularly his investments in the rubber industry.</p>
      <p>Aldrich's principal correspondents include William B. Allison, Henry B. Anthony, Jonathan Bourne, Jr., Charles R. Brayton, Jonathan Chace, William E. Chandler, Charles A. Conant, Henry P. Davison, Eugene Hale, Philander C. Knox, Charles Warren Lippitt, Stephen B. Luce, Orville H. Platt, Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, Henry M. Teller, Paul M. Warburg, and George Peabody Wetmore.</p>
