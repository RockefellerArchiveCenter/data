    <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
<p>Lewis Wendell Hackett was born in Benicia, California, on December 14, 1884. He received an A.B. degree from Harvard University in 1905 and an M.D. from Harvard Medical School in 1912. He had become interested in public health administration and was appointed Assistant in Preventive Medicine and Hygiene at the university. During the following year, he organized and taught a laboratory and field course in hygiene. In 1913, he was granted the first Dr.P.H. degree given at Harvard Medical School. He was promoted to Instructor in Preventive Medicine and Hygiene, and in this capacity he helped to organize the first school for public health officers in the United States.</p><p>In 1914, Dr. Hackett was recruited for the field staff of the newly organized International Health Board of the Rockefeller Foundation. His next 35 years were spent in 17 foreign countries investigating and combating hookworm disease and malaria and promoting public health. His first assignment was to conduct hookworm control demonstrations in Panama, British Honduras, and Guatemala. He also took charge of the Brazilian program in 1916 and expanded the work to include malaria control and the development of public health organizations.</p><p>The second major period of Dr. Hackett's employment began in 1924 when he took charge of the International Health Board project in Italy, where malaria was active in 38 of the 69 provinces. Control demonstrations were first organized in Sardinia. His use of Paris green as a larvacide was effective and was extended to other areas. He was instrumental in establishing a Central Malaria Experiment Station in Rome for the study of the anopheline mosquito. Of the six identified varieties of the maculipennis complex, two were confirmed as significant in the spread of malaria. In 1936, Dr. Hackett set up an Albanian field station for similar anopheline research. His book, "Malaria in Europe," published in 1937, summarized his studies to date. In 1939, his field laboratory work was extended to the Nile delta in Egypt. The Foundation closed its Rome office in 1940, when Italy entered the Second World War.</p><p>The remaining nine years of Dr. Hackett's service were spent as Director of the Rio de la Plata and Andean regional office in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where he administered programs in Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, Bolivia, Peru, and Uruguay. He found a generally unpromising situation, with the medical profession dominated by politics and the public health concept erroneous or non-existent. The war, lack of qualified personnel, and political instability combined to impede progress. A health center in Chile and nursing schools in Ecuador and Peru were the most solid achievements. The rise of a totalitarian government in Argentina curbed International Health Division activities there, and the Buenos Aires office was closed in September 1949.</p><p>At his retirement in December 1949, Dr. Hackett was an Associate Director of the IHD. He settled in Berkeley, where he became Visiting Professor of Public Health at the University of California and Editor-in-Chief of the "American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene." He was a member of many scientific and learned societies and served on commissions of the League of Nations and World Health Organization. Among his many honors were decorations from the governments of Italy, Chile, Bolivia, and Ecuador. His many published articles included a contribution to the "Encyclopedia Britannica" on tropical medicine, and at his death on April 28, 1962, he was working on another book, a history of the International Health Division. Much of his material was subsequently included in Greer Williams' "The Plague Killers."</p>  </bioghist>

Although the series contains little official data, there is much that illustrates his talent for vivid description of the countries in which he worked and traveled.

There are some letters from Hazel to Dr. Hackett and to his mother. Letters to and from a few others, including his son Robert, will also be found in this subseries. The major topics covered are Dr. Hackett's duties and experiences during his internships at several Boston hospitals--these double as love letters during his engagement to Hazel and occur sometimes twice daily--and the unofficial details of his first assignment with the International Health Board in Panama. The letters begin to thin out in 1919, but there is interesting material about Italy scattered throughout the 1920s and an especially fascinating group of letters in July 1934, about his first trip through Russia.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="ece204e74ac2a22bb84f00c1fc56f38b"><head>Arrangement</head><p>This subseries is arranged chronologically.</p></arrangement><c id="e45958361b6e404eadf34ec5b1229e11" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence - Personal</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" datechar="creation" era="ce" normal="1875-01/1911-06" type="inclusive">1875-1911 June</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="58d1f187a356561968a5b815626c45ea" label="mixed materials [A0000000068159]" type="box">8A</container><container id="b377d7bb2567d1fcbac8cf005ea4b27b" parent="58d1f187a356561968a5b815626c45ea" type="folder">154.01-154.06</container></did></c><c id="e232b8b3ed7e4ce5a70595c2795d8a6d" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence - Personal</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" datechar="creation" era="ce" normal="1911-08/1912-06" type="inclusive">1911 August-1912 June</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="1f8d7cfb5de2d34f784232d62bbc2d80" label="mixed materials [A0000000068160]" type="box">8B</container><container id="d095005be871b8c136efcb1f0a8e0917" parent="1f8d7cfb5de2d34f784232d62bbc2d80" type="folder">154.07-154.12</container></did></c><c id="4e3a3b7eda4f46fb9d35e58400581daa" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence - Personal</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" datechar="creation" era="ce" normal="1912-07/1919-12" type="inclusive">1912 July-1919 December</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="a405800dce1e5e7624322173c4916c31" label="mixed materials [A0000000068161]" type="box">8C</container><container id="ebec0277b6538590bc54436b1ee45291" parent="a405800dce1e5e7624322173c4916c31" type="folder">154.13-154.22</container></did></c><c id="fd68c55ec2204236b921709397fe52d1" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence - Personal</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1920/1948" type="inclusive">1920 May-1948</unitdate><physloc id="abd17309c49a3986de7ba7dd33a9b677">There is a bug with the AT that is not accepting "8D" as the value for the Container 1 Indicator field.

The former are fully expanded, while the latter are usually brief notes. Some periods are missing or not covered. Most thoroughly documented are Hackett's early months in Italy in 1924 and his entire stay in Argentina from 1940 through September 1949. (All of the latter is duplicated in Hackett's diaries in the Rockefeller Foundation archives.) The years before 1924 are scarcely covered. The travel diaries are particularly interesting for human interest and local color.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="7f76460fa27cc8ec89673cd929ae145e"><head>Arrangement note</head><p>This series is arranged chronologically.</p></arrangement><c id="aac1c82717cf4808b0a97ae6cf3038f7" level="file"><did><unittitle>Manuscript - Travel in Egypt, India</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1927/1928" type="inclusive">December 8, 1927-January 7, 1928</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="344464b8201de094056fe589be9a374e" label="mixed materials [A0000000068163]" type="box">9</container><container id="9767b94e2ee71151f46f1b3af2789e68" parent="344464b8201de094056fe589be9a374e" type="folder">155</container></did></c><c id="f1d1833b577549e3a87689180994b3ac" level="file"><did><unittitle>1 Book - Honduras and Guatemala</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1916/1916" type="inclusive">1916</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="cac34b8948d6ec7e196ee68d929a0a07" label="mixed materials [A0000000068163]" type="box">9</container><container id="bd5e356580945ddf8890c321054df8f2" parent="cac34b8948d6ec7e196ee68d929a0a07" type="folder">A</container></did></c><c id="39251ed7643b400cbedd5dafeba435ad" level="file"><did><unittitle>1 Book (Xerox Copy) - U.

Most of those in Spanish or Portuguese have been translated. The subjects are epidemiology, current trends in public health, and general observations of South America. One talk includes an excellent explanation of the Foundation's aims and policies. There are also four manuscript drafts of journal articles and 32 reprints of other articles, mostly on malaria. These are arranged alphabetically by title. Included are three chapters he contributed to "Malariology," by Mark F. Boyd (2v., Saunders, 1949); his "Encyclopedia Britannica" entry on tropical medicine; and three feature stories for "Brazilian American" magazine in 1922.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="61ee047833c5ae4d82932d7fd6a73715"><head>Arrangement note</head><p>The speeches in this series are arranged chronologically.

Hackett Photograph Collection spans the period 1885-1962. The majority of the contents in this collection are photographs taken by Dr. Hackett during his tenure with the International Health Division/Board. Also, included in this collection are pictures of the Hackett family and home, Lewis Hackett as a child, and documentation of various ailments and diseases throughout the world. Lewis W. Hackett spent much of his career in South America and Eastern Europe, as is evidenced by the volume of photographs from these regions. The collection, however, is not limited to these regions, as nearly all of the continents are represented in the extensive visual collection. The photograph collection is housed in 41 boxes and contains photographs, negatives, slides, and post cards.  Dr. Hackett was an avid and competent photographer, and varied subjects from most of the countries in which Dr. Hackett worked or traveled are represented.</p></scopecontent><fileplan

Hackett intended. Each album is complete with a list identifying the negatives contained therein. These negative albums have corresponding prints that have been extracted and foldered. The albums and folders are housed together for cross-referencing. There appears to have been an original series of 1-13, but the existing series begins with number 4 and is missing number 9. Album 6 is missing, but the negatives remain in order and the identification list is contained in the folder. This subseries also includes a negative album that is not part of the numbered series described above. It is housed separately in box 29 and contains identification of all photos.</p></scopecontent><c id="dde9bf8aa14a4fcebb8fca351cd53961" level="file"><did><unittitle>Negative Album 4 - Basilicata</unittitle><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="4d32bc47bc506a93958a9fec0a537916" label="Still Image [A0000000089217]" type="box">26</container><container id="35939cefd2ef66865b4b562163a6ceb0" parent="4d32bc47bc506a93958a9fec0a537916" type="folder">77</container></did><scopecontent id="ad18678eddd31cba6d8e6d264325f336"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>Basilicata, negative album, corresponding prints in order of list in album</p></scopecontent></c><c id="cb5575aa495a435286fb8a9bfdb6cda8" level="file"><did><unittitle>Negative Album 5 - Sardegna (Sardinia)</unittitle><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="e8e9fce3bf4f4d111469121f1af6f01d" label="Still Image [A0000000089217]" type="box">26</container><container id="74ac69c7c4a8fdf9bc31131ee59a96bc" parent="e8e9fce3bf4f4d111469121f1af6f01d" type="folder">78</container></did></c><c id="b47570fca3cc4430bf84f26bd3e22d13" level="file"><did><unittitle>Negative Album 6 - Albania</unittitle><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="1b71225e551143e5eba50aa4794ceca1" label="Still Image [A0000000089217]" type="box">26</container><container id="776c3dfef99198e8f9cafb94679c4101" parent="1b71225e551143e5eba50aa4794ceca1" type="folder">79</container></did><scopecontent id="d73f92c7effbad6bf7727acfce6c5a37"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>Albania.
