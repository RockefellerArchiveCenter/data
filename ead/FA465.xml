    <head>Processing Information note</head>
<p>Since the contents of the Maps and flat files has inherently been separated from other archival holdings, the description of any individual item, or set of items, may also currently appear, in some form, in the finding aid for the originating collection.</p><p>Future processing, description, and presentation of the Maps and flat files will seek to address this issue as much as feasible.</p>  </processinfo>
  <scopecontent id="191e51487b046a7802587a97a984aa82">
    <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
<p>Maps and flat files is an artificial collection created by the RAC in order to efficiently and effectively manage and present the oversized flat materials across all our archival holdings.</p><p>This material includes but is not necessarily limited to: architectural drawings, artwork, blueprints, charts, citations, oversized documents, graphs, maps, photographs, posters, publications, renderings, whiteprints, and other such items that necessitate flat storage.</p>  </scopecontent>
  <separatedmaterial id="b36e41cea639c07539c5fade50352cae">
    <head>Separated Materials note</head>
<p>The majority of the maps and flat files have been physically separated from an archival collection.</p><p>When the specifics of this separation are known, the details are provided either in this finding aid, or writen on a separation sheet physically accompanying the item.</p><p>In many cases, the specific details of the provenance are simply unknown.</p>  </separatedmaterial>
