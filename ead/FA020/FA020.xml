      <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
      <p>Elvin A. Kabat (1914-2000), a pioneer in the field of immunochemistry, worked for three decades on standardizing immunological science. In the late 1930s he worked as a Fellow at the Institute of Physical Chemistry for the Rockefeller Foundation and later he was a leading member of the faculty at Columbia University. He spent much of his early career working on the structure and immunochemistry of blood-group substances, analyzing the binding properties of antibodies and developing immunodiagnostic tests for multiple sclerosis. He paved the way for the modern experimental autoimmunity process. Kabat also devoted much of his time to mentoring new and often passed-over scientists. He aided foreign medical and chemistry students and provided opportunities to women and African American students in the United States during a time when these opportunities were virtually non-existent.</p>
      <p>Through his hard work and endless efforts, a Kabat database was created to aid students in standard immunochemistry. Kabat was also a prolific writer. He authored numerous books, including "Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interests" and "Kabat and Mayer's Experimental Immunochemistry," which became the text book for all future graduate and doctoral students. He often submitted articles on his latest research and contributed to the Immunochemical Studies on Blood Groups.</p>
      <p>Kabat was known for his tireless pursuit of honesty and justice. Through the Freedom of Information Act, Dr. Kabat discovered that during the McCarthy era he was placed on a watch list because of his Eastern European heritage and because of his work with the National Research Council and the United States military.</p>
