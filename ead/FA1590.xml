<p>The Rockefeller Brothers Fund (RBF) was established in 1940 by the five sons of John D. Rockefeller Jr. and Abby Aldrich Rockefeller: John D. 3rd, Nelson A., Laurance S., Winthrop, and David Rockefeller, as a vehicle for the members of the Brothers generation to systematically coordinate their philanthropic giving as well as share consultants, advice, and resources. Its endowment was created through a gift from JDR Jr. in 1951, and a subsequent bequest from his estate in 1960. Abby Rockefeller Mauz√©, the eldest sibling and the only daughter of John D. Jr. and Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, joined the RBF Board in 1954.</p><p>John D. Rockefeller 3rd served as president of the Fund from its inception until 1956. Other past presidents have included: Nelson A. Rockefeller, 1956-1958; Laurance S. Rockefeller, 1958-1968; Dana S. Creel, 1968-1975; William M. Dietel, 1975-1987; and Colin G. Campbell, 1998-2000.</p>  </bioghist>
