    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The collection chiefly contains Fellow files from the Ford Foundation's Leadership Development Program. Records within the files document the entire lifespan of the LDP (1966-1977), but they also include a few materials collected about Fellows from before and after the program's existence. Fellow files are grouped according to which Regional LDP Office the represented Fellows had to report. The LDP maintained four regional offices. They included the Region-at-Large Office, the Northeast Region Office, the Southwest Region Office, and the Southeast Region Office. The collection also contains a group of Ford Foundation financial materials unrelated to the LDP. Access to the financial materials is restricted.</p><p>
For the most part, the Ford Foundation maintained two distinct files for each LDP Fellow with one file holding original narrative reports submitted to the Fellow's Regional LDP Office by the Fellow and one file holding narrative report copies submitted to the Ford Foundation by the Regional LDP Office. The print on the narrative report copies is generally of less quality than that of the original reports. If, when searching through a particular Fellow file, users find reports that have unclear text, they are advised to look for better quality versions of the reports in the other file (or files) associated with that Fellow.</p><p>
Subheadings such as "Reports" and "Regular Reports" were found upon many of the original folders that housed the LDP Fellow files. These subheadings are noted in the rehoused physical folders as well as in the Finding Aid's intellectual description in order to help preserve the original internal arrangement of the Fellow files. However, users are advised that these subheadings do not appear to have been applied consistently and that they are not wholly accurate in describing the content of a particular subsection within a file.</p><p>
In addition to reports, the Fellow Files are principally comprised of three types of correspondence: 1) Correspondence between individual LDP Fellows and their respective Regional Representative/Program Consultants; 2) Correspondence between Regional Representative/Program Consultants and Ford LDP Staff; and 3) Correspondence between Regional Representative/Program Consultants and organizations that provided internships and other learning opportunities to Fellows.  Correspondence generally regards submissions of reports, fellowship progress, fellowship changes, and post-fellowship activities. Some personal correspondence between individual LDP Fellows and their respective Regional Representative/Program Consultants appears as well. These documents generally consist of holiday cards and family announcements.</p><p>
Also prevalent throughout the collection are materials formats such as newspaper clippings, academic papers, photographs, receipts and financial documentation, classroom tools and learning materials, project proposals and plans, fellowship application documents, publications, pamphlets, flyers, and newsletters. These materials help document the Fellows' program year activities and post-fellowship actions. Additionally, there are two audio recordings that appear to contain the narrative reports of two different LDP Fellows who wished to give oral accounts of their program progress.</p><p>
Most LDP Fellows were grassroots leaders in the fields of education, social work, economic development, and community organization, and within their program-years, they explored a vast array of issues, trends, and solutions associated with those areas. The records housed within their files therefore relate to such diverse subjects as curriculum development, individualized instruction, humanities education, bilingual/bicultural education, African American studies, sex education, environmental education, special education, child psychology, early childhood development, guidance counseling, vocational education, recreational programs, use of audiovisual materials in education, public housing, public health, drug and alcohol abuse, voting rights protections, civil rights, employment discrimination, minority leadership in public schools, Native American land claims, school desegregation, student rights, child care, student protests, public broadcast television, strip-mining protests, Head-Start programs, human relations, interracial relations, teaching in multiracial classrooms, education for migrant workers, manpower development, teacher education, public welfare, and education philosophy among many others.</p><p>
Many LDP Fellows originated from impoverished and/or racial minority communities and sought to use their program years to become better leaders for those populations. Thus, their Fellow files contain large amounts of materials concerning African Americans, Native Americans, and Mexican Americans as well as predominately poor white communities in the Appalachian Mountains Region. Materials show connections between individual Fellows' activities and larger social movements of the 1960s and 1970s, including the cultural identity and civil rights movements of Africa American, Native American, and Mexican American peoples.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Established in 1966, the Ford Foundation's Leadership Development Program sought to provide fellowships to American community leaders working in the areas of education, social work, economic development, and political organization. Most LDP fellowships lasted for a year, and Fellows exercised a large amount of freedom in designing their individual program years. These programs consisted of internships, academic courses, workshops, site visits, conferences, and volunteer placements that would all provide opportunities for Fellows to learn and develop as community leaders. placements that would all provide opportunities for Fellows to learn and develop as community leaders. Ford required Fellows to submit both narrative and financial reports to their specific Regional Representative/Program Consultants in order to document their program progress and allowed expenses. The foundation started to phase out the program in 1975 due to a belief that the program's objective had been achieved as well as to a shift in the foundation's annual spending (David Nevin, "Left-Handed Fastballers: Scouting and Recruiting America's Grass-Roots Leaders"). The LDP ceased to operate in 1977. </p><p>
The LDP was organized into four regional offices: 1) Region-at-Large; 2) Northeast; 3) Southwest; and 4) Southeast. Each regional office recruited Fellows from the geographic area that its title represented with the Region-at-Large Office chiefly selecting Fellows from Alaska, the Northwestern states, and the Appalachian Mountains Region. Most Fellows were teachers and school administrators, but there were also social workers and various types of community organizers selected for LDP Fellowships. Fellows generally originated from the types of communities in which they sought to become leaders and had strong personal investments in the issues they sought to address. Many of these communities were disempowered economically, socially, and politically. Several represented different minority populations throughout the country such as Native American, Mexican American, and African American communities in various geographic areas. Regional LDP Offices prioritized knowledge of community issues, demonstrated work in helping communities, and perceived leadership qualities in selecting individuals for fellowships. In order to be accepted to the program, Fellows needed to possess a capacity for personal initiative (Nevin).</p><p>
Although Fellows primarily focused on developing local solutions to problems facing their particular communities, their program years consisted largely of travel to other areas where they could broaden their perspectives and assist other groups. This travel connected them with regional, national, and federal organizations trying to address the larger issues that impacted their home communities. Thus, many Fellows' program activities and later post-fellowship careers intersected heavily with significant U.S. social movements of the 1960s and 1970s. These movements include the cultural identity and civil rights movements of Native Americans, Mexican Americans, and African Americans. Student protests impacted a large number of LDP fellowships.</p><p>
Ford invested more than eleven million dollars into the LDP throughout the course of the program's lifespan (Nevin). While one-year fellowship were generally the norm, the LDP also issued short-term fellowships that lasted for a few months.</p>  </bioghist>

<p>The collection is divided into five series and fourteen subseries. </p><p>The first four series consist entirely of Ford Foundation Leadership Development Program Fellow files, while the fifth series contains miscellaneous materials related to the Ford Foundation in general.</p><p>In regards to the first four series, each one contains the Fellow files of a particular Regional LDP Office. The order of the offices within the collection is as follows: 1. Region-at-Large; 2. Northeast; 3. Southwest; and 4. Southeast.  Within each of these series, files are generally arranged in the ascending alphabetical order of the different LDP Fellows' surnames. Each individual LDP Fellow generally has two corresponding Fellow files.</p><p>The series were then broken into smaller subseries (two subseries for Series 1 and four subseries for Series 2, 3, and 4) during processing in order to improve user access to the large number of files produced by each Regional Office. </p><p>The fifth series has no subseries.</p><p>The collection arrangement is as follows:</p><p>Series 1.

For the most part, these files follow the general organizational scheme imposed by the records' creators for all Fellow files documenting the LDP.  This means that most Region-at-Large Fellows have two files for their associated records: One file holding original narrative reports submitted to Region-at-Large Regional Representative/Program Consultant Paul Nachtigal by the individual Fellow and one file holding narrative report copies submitted to the Ford Foundation by Nachtigal's office.  The Region-at-Large files are also comprised of the same type of content as the rest of the Fellow files found within the collection.  In addition to narrative reports, they chiefly contain correspondence between Nachtigal and individual Fellows, correspondence between Nachtigal and Ford LDP staff, and correspondence between Nachtigal and organizations that provided internships and other learning opportunities to LDP Fellows. Correspondence generally regards submissions of reports, fellowship progress, fellowship changes, and post-fellowship activities.   </p><p>
The LDP Region-at-Large Selection Committee recruited Fellows from the states of Alaska, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. The Highlander Research and Education Center, a social justice leadership training program and cultural center in Tennessee, proved to be a popular internship placement for LDP Fellows of this region.</p><p>
Many Region-at-Large LDP Fellows focused on developing and improving the economic, education, political, and community organization resources of Appalachian and Native American populations. The series documents the emphasis on arts, culture, and history within the work of Fellows serving both types of communities. For example, several Fellow files contain records concerning Appalachian folklore, folk schools, and oral histories while others contain records concerning Native American crafts and cultural objects. Furthermore, the materials collected in some Appalachia-focused Fellow files document the use of audiovisual technologies and public broadcast television as tools for education and community organization. Sample classroom materials, pamphlets, and other types of records provide evidence of Fellows investigating, supporting, and establishing bilingual and bicultural programs for Native American children.</p><p>
Environmental issues provide another link between the records of the Appalachian Fellows and the records of the Native American Fellows. Within the series, there are a number of Fellow files that document the conflict between local Appalachian communities and strip-mining companies as well as the efforts of some communities to protect the health of their coal miners and combat Black Lung Disease. Conversely, there are a number of Fellow files that document the efforts of Native American communities to assert land claims and contest oil company interests.</p><p>
Other files in the series show that the remainder of the Region-at-Large LDP Fellows chiefly worked with African American and Mexican American communities.</p><p>
In addition to correspondence and reports, the series holds pamphlets, newsletters, promotional documents, draft classroom exercise materials and learning tools, press clippings, and one audio recording.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="2fc6cae0c936519c54bbed83592d6e74"><head>Arrangement</head><p>This series was broken into two subseries during processing in order to improve user access to the large number of files produced by the Region-at-Large Office.</p><p>The series arrangement is as follows:</p><p>Series 1 Subseries 1.

For the most part, these files follow the general organizational scheme imposed by the records' creators for all Fellow files documenting the LDP.  This means that most Northeast Region Fellows have two files for their associated records: One file holding original narrative reports submitted to Northeast Regional Representative/Program Consultant Paul Judkins by the individual Fellow and one file holding narrative report copies submitted to the Ford Foundation by Judkins' office.  The Northeast Region files are also comprised of the same type of content as the rest of the Fellow files found within the collection.  In addition to narrative reports, they chiefly contain correspondence between Judkins and individual Fellows, correspondence between Judkins and Ford LDP staff, and correspondence between Judkins and organizations that provided internships and other learning opportunities to LDP Fellows. Correspondence generally regards submissions of reports, fellowship progress, fellowship changes, and post fellowship activities.</p><p>
The LDP Northeast Region Selection Committee recruited Fellows from the states of Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont as well as from the New Brunswick Province of Canada. Judkin's Office kept fellowship application documents and Fellow evaluation reports within many of the Fellow files.</p><p>
Northeast Region LDP Fellows generally focused on the areas of education, psychology, and guidance counseling. Records contained within the various Fellow files provide evidence that many Fellows sought to improve public education through the refinement and implementation of innovative teaching styles such as individualized instruction as well as through the reimagining of course curricula. The topic of humanities studies and humanistic education appears throughout many of the files. Fellows designed their program years around such specific education subjects as bilingual education, environmental education, sex education, and recreational programs. A particularly large number of files consists of records concerning special education services. The intended recipients of these services varied between students with physical disabilities, learning disabilities, mental disabilities, and emotional disabilities.</p><p>
Materials related to special education services also appear within the files of those Fellows who pursued psychology-focused program years. Child development and mental health are other prominent subjects within those Fellows' files. Lastly, documents related to career development and vocational training can be found within the records of those Fellows who emphasized guidance counseling in their program and post-fellowship activities.</p><p>
African Americans and Native Americans were the two most prominent minority groups served by Northeast Region LDP Fellows.</p><p>
In addition to correspondence and reports, the series holds pamphlets, newsletters, press clippings, papers, publications, and postcards.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aa0fe2a89de334cf2976d2ab4fb822dd"><head>Arrangement</head><p>This series was broken into four subseries during processing in order to improve user access to the large number of files produced by the Northeast Region Office.</p><p>The series arrangement is as follows:</p><p>Series 2 Subseries 1.

For the most part, these files follow the general organizational scheme imposed by the records' creators for all Fellow files documenting the LDP.  This means that most Southwest Region Fellows have two files for their associated records: One file holding original narrative reports submitted to Southwest Regional Representative/Program Consultant David Grant by the individual Fellow and one file holding narrative report copies submitted to the Ford Foundation by Grant's office.  The Southwest Region files are also comprised of the same type of content as the rest of the Fellow files found within the collection.  In addition to narrative reports, they chiefly contain correspondence between Grant and individual Fellows, correspondence between Grant and Ford LDP staff, and correspondence between Grant and organizations that provided internships and other learning opportunities to LDP Fellows. Correspondence generally regards submissions of reports, fellowship progress, fellowship changes, and post-fellowship activities.</p><p>
The LDP Southwest Region Selection Committee recruited Fellows from the states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, and Utah. Popular Internship placements and collaborating organizations for Southwest LDP Fellows included the American G.I. Forum, the Juarez-Lincoln Center (or Juarez Lincoln University), the Southwest Council of La Raza, the Colorado Migrant Council, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, and the Southwest Educational Development Laboratory. Some Fellows' activities also intersected with the work of Federal Government organizations like the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Inter-Agency Committee on Mexican American Affairs. It appears that in addition to quarterly narrative reports, Grant's Office required monthly reports for Fellows of the Southwest Region to submit. This kind of report is found within many Fellow files in the series.</p><p>
Many Southwest LDP Fellows focused on developing and improving the economic, education, political, and community organization resources of Mexican American and Native American populations.  The Series documents the conflict between Mexican American communities and local school boards throughout various school districts in the late 1960s and early 1970s that often resulted in student protests and boycotts. Fellows assisted and directed different programs and initiatives designed to help these communities improve their children's education opportunities. Many Fellow files hold records related to efforts to address the needs for bilingual education programs and more Mexican American teachers and administrators in public schools with large Mexican American student populations. Fellows also sought to improve education opportunities for adults. Within the series, some files contain materials related to education services for migrant workers.</p><p>
Several significant social movements advanced by Mexican Americans during this time period are documented by the press clippings and correspondence collected within the Fellow files as well as by the records concerning the Fellows' program and post-fellowship activities. These movements include the actions of the United Farm Workers union, the Chicano cultural identity movement, and the Mexican American Civil Rights Movement. In regards to the Mexican American Civil Rights Movement, Fellow files include materials that discuss efforts to secure inclusion of Mexican Americans within the Voting Rights Act of 1965 as well as relations between Mexican American civil rights groups and African American civil rights groups. In addition to selecting a large number of Mexican American and Native American-focused Fellows, the LDP Southwest Region also recruited several Fellows that concentrated on helping African American communities. Materials collected in the files of these Fellows document initiatives to establish African American studies programs as well as various programs to nurture individual and community economic development.</p><p>
Economic development, bilingual/bicultural education, alcoholism treatment, and public housing are all prevalent subjects within the records of those Fellows who pursued an interest in assisting Native American communities.</p><p>

For the most part, these files follow the general organizational scheme imposed by the records' creators for all Fellow files documenting the LDP.  This means that most Southeast Region Fellows have two files for their associated records: One file holding original narrative reports submitted to Region-at-Large Regional Representative/Program Consultants Dorothy Hassfeld (1966-1968) and K.Z. Chavis (1968-1977) by the individual Fellow and one file holding narrative report copies submitted to the Ford Foundation by the Southeast office.  The Southeast Region files are also comprised of the same type of content as the rest of the Fellow files found within the collection.  In addition to narrative reports, they chiefly contain correspondence between the Southeast Region Office and individual Fellows, correspondence between the Southeast Region Office and Ford LDP staff, and correspondence between the Southeast Region Office and organizations that provided internships and other learning opportunities to LDP Fellows. Correspondence generally regards submissions of reports, fellowship progress, fellowship changes, and post-fellowship activities.</p><p>
The LDP Southeast Region Selection Committee recruited Fellows from the states of Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee. It appears that the Southeast Region Office required Fellows to submit a more structured style of narrative report than those received by the other LDP Regions. This kind of report is found within many Fellow files in the series. Fellow files also hold a large quantity of fellowship application documents.</p><p>
The majority of Southeast LDP Fellows focused on developing and improving the economic, education, political, and community organization resources of African American populations. Fellow files contain records concerning the implementation and impact of school desegregation in the American South during the 1960s and 1970s. These records document many Southeast LDP Fellows' efforts to promote and protect the rights of black students in desegregated schools as well as to advocate for greater cultural awareness in teaching practices for multiracial classes. Reading skill improvement and early childhood development are other prominent education related subjects that appear within the series.</p><p>
Important African American social movements of the time are documented by more records in the series than just those concerning desegregation. Materials provide evidence of some Fellows working to protect voting rights for African Americans. Moreover, many Fellow files contain records that regard the cultural shift in African American communities when people started seeking a stronger connection to their black identities. A few of these records originate from Fellows exploring African Americans studies programs in their fellowship years.</p><p>
Lastly, many Southeast LDP Fellows worked with initiatives that sought to help African American individuals and communities cultivate economic self-sufficiency and self-empowerment. Records found within the files of these Fellows concern such subjects as agricultural cooperatives, consumer education, and vocational training.</p><p>
In addition to correspondence and reports, the Series holds newsletters, pamphlets, academic papers, press clippings, flyers, photographs, postcards, and one audio recording.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="75fc343a9ab8814cd268be8fbccdec72"><head>Arrangement</head><p>This series was broken into four subseries during processing in order to improve user access to the large number of files produced by the Southeast Region Office.</p><p>The series arrangement is as follows:</p><p>Series 4 Subseries 1.
