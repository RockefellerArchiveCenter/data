<p>The Ford Foundation was chartered by Henry and Edsel Ford in 1936 "to receive and administer funds for scientific, educational and charitable purposes, all for the public welfare", and initially served the Ford family's charitable interests in the Detroit area. Following the deaths of Edsel Ford (1943) and Henry Ford (1947), the Foundation was propelled to the forefront of philanthropy as the largest American foundation in terms of both endowment and yearly expenditures, and with an international scope to its major program areas. During the Foundation's first twenty years its major programs were in international economic development, primary and higher education, educational and public broadcasting, behavioral sciences, civil liberties, urban development, fine arts and the humanities. The Ford Foundation also partnered with the Rockefeller Foundation in supporting agricultural development in South America, Africa, and Southeast Asia. Since the 1970s, the Foundation has also pioneered programs in women's rights, energy policy, micro-financing in under-developed countries, establishing human rights groups, and improving international HIV/AIDS education.</p>  </bioghist>

<p>Jacqueline Berrien (1961-2015) was a lawyer, foundation program officer, and Chairwoman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) under President Barack Obama. Between 2001 and 2004, she worked as a Program Officer in the Ford Foundation's Governance and Civil Society Program (GCS). In this position she managed a grant portfolio for projects related to Participation and Representation in American Politics.</p><p>
Prior to joining the Ford Foundation, Berrien worked as a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) (1987-1992), the Lawyer's Committee for Civil Rights Under Law (1992-1994), and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Legal Defense and Education Fund (NAACP LDF) (1995-2001). She returned to the NAACP LDF as Associate Director-Counsel in 2004 after leaving the Foundation. She was then appointed to be the Chair of the EEOC by President Obama in 2009.</p><p>
Berrien was born in Washington, D.C. on November 28, 1961. She earned her BA from Oberlin College in 1983 and then earned her Doctor of Law from Harvard Law School in 1986.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>Collection contains the office files of Ford Foundation Program Officer Jacqueline Berrien. Working in the Governance and Civil Society (GCS) unit of the Peace and Social Justice Program (PSJ), Berrien managed a grant portfolio for projects concerning Participation and Representation in American Politics. The grants encompassed within this portfolio fell under two initiatives: 1) Democracy and Diversity; and 2) Reclaiming Politics for the Public. Projects related to the Democracy and Diversity initiative focused on ensuring the right to vote to more of the American public and increasing diverse participation and representation in politics. Projects related to the Reclaiming Politics for the Public initiative focused on empowering the voting public and encouraging its interest in politics.</p><p>
The collection consists of one series of Berrien's subject files. These files chiefly contain research and news on subjects concerning Berrien's grant portfolio as well as materials documenting the drafting of a Program Officer Memo (POM) Berrien wrote in 2003. Ford Foundation Program Officers used the POMs to communicate the course of action they sought to take with their grant portfolios. Although Berrien served in the GCS only between 2001 and 2004, there are materials within the collection that date back to as early as 1965. These documents were submitted to and retrieved by Berrien as research material for her work. They concern topics relevant to her grant portfolio such as voting rights and electoral redistricting and mainly consist of memos, reports, and publications. In addition to these types of records and the drafts and notes showing Berrien's writing and editing of her POM, there are also news articles, brochures, correspondence, and one audio tape in the collection. Other topics discussed within the collection include felony disenfranchisement, political participation of racial and ethnic minorities, women, and youth, political representation of minorities and women, electoral campaign finance reform, and the 2000 United States presidential election.</p>  </scopecontent>

<p>Collection is comprised of two accessions: Accession 2019:150 and Accession 2019:177. Both accessions contained the staff subject files of Jacqueline Berrien, and the box numbers on the original containers housing the accessions aligned sequentially. Therefore, it was decided to process the two accessions together as one collection of Jacqueline Berrien office files.</p><p>Processing Level 3: Standard Processing</p><p>Processed by Darren Young, February 2020</p>  </processinfo>
