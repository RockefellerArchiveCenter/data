<p>The John A. Hartford Foundation (JAHF) was established in 1929 by brothers John and George Hartford, sons of the founder of the Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company (A&amp;P). The foundation is a private, nonpartisan philanthropy dedicated to improving the care of older adults. </p><p>For its first several decades, the foundation broadly supported clinical medical research. By 1982, it began to focus solely on geriatric healthcare. In 2015, JAHF paid out $20.2 million on a total of 80 active grants and committed $25.3 million to 24 new grants projects, all focused on the care of older adults.</p>  </bioghist>
