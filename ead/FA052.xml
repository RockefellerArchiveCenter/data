    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Plant pathologist, educator, and humanitarian, Elvin Charles Stakman was one of the most important figures in agricultural science during the first half of the twentieth century.  He was born on May 17, 1885, at Algoma, Wisconsin, and received his undergraduate (1906) and Ph.D. degrees (1913) from the University of Minnesota.  From 1909 until 1953 he was a member of the faculty of that university, retiring with the rank of Distinguished Professor.</p><p>Dr. Stakman's principal scientific fame came from his studies of wheat stem rusts.  He discovered that this crop disease was not a single stable entity but a fungus that evolved into new strains which could infect plants resistant to its earlier forms.  Among the scientists who collaborated in his efforts to control this blight and develop new rust-resistant strains of wheat were Norman Borlaug, who won a Nobel Prize for his work, and J. George Harrar, later president of The Rockefeller Foundation.  Both were graduate students of Dr. Stakman.</p><p>Dr. Stakman played a major role in the Rockefeller Foundation's efforts to increase food production in developing countries.  This grew out of an assignment in the 1940s on behalf of the Foundation to undertake an examination of agricultural productivity in Mexico.  His recommendation that the Foundation initiate a major program to improve crop yields in developing countries led to the Foundation's early involvement in the so-called "Green Revolution."</p><p>After his retirement from the University of Minnesota in 1953, Dr. Stakman worked as a consultant for The Rockefeller Foundation, a post he retained until his death.  He also accepted a series of visiting professorships at universities in the United States, Mexico, and India during this period.</p><p>Dr. Stakman married Louise Jensen, a member of the University of Minnesota faculty, on September 6, 1917.  She predeceased him.  Dr. Stakman died in St. Paul, Minnesota, on January 22, 1979.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The E. C. Stakman Papers contain few items of a personal nature.  Consisting of clippings, correspondence, program notes listing Dr. Stakman as a speaker, reprints, and speeches (mostly testimonials to Dr. Stakman), the papers reflect only the public side of his career.  Over three-quarters of this collection consists of reprints.  Most of the correspondence here is incoming rather than from the hand of Dr. Stakman.  Only a few items reflect his activities on behalf of The Rockefeller Foundation.</p>  </scopecontent>
