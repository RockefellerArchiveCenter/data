    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The Rockefeller University, established in 1901 by John D. Rockefeller as The Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, was the first institution in the United States devoted solely to biomedical research. The earliest work was carried on through grants-in-aid to researchers in various American (and a few European) laboratories, but that program was phased out after the Institute's own laboratories were opened on its New York City campus in 1906. In 1954, the Institute became part of the University of the State of New York and acquired the right to confer graduate degrees, awarding its first Ph.D. in 1959. The Institute became The Rockefeller University in 1965.</p><p>The University archives delineate the growth of research programs which from the beginning were aimed at developing fundamental knowledge of disease and physiology. Research is carried out in interdisciplinary laboratories headed by leading scientists, who were known for more than fifty years as Members of the Institute and subsequently as Professors. A hospital was opened in 1910 and has remained an integral part of the research program.</p>  </bioghist>
