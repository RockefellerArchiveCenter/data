    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Program Files, Record Group 5, describe the activities of each of the four program areas, Journalism, Education, Arts and Culture and Community Initiatives. They contain the correspondence and subject files of their officers, and documents which trace the origins and progress of the various initiatives which distinguish Knight Foundation in areas such as undergraduate education, the development of community foundations, minority and mid-career journalism education, museum loan networking, literacy, immunization, and the development of symphony orchestras, etc. The Strategic Planning records provide insight into how the Foundation sought to deal with its growth and create a plan for its future. The Foundation's 2000 reorganization resulted in reorganizing the Program areas into the Community Partners Program, the establishment of the National Venture Fund, and the reaffirmation of the Journalism program. Also included are Endowment files from 1987 through 2004.</p>  </scopecontent>
