    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>Collection is chiefly comprised of 3x5 index cards that describe Ford Foundation grant-related publications. The generated publications were published between 1951 and 1992, and the grant projects that generated them were all initiated between 1950 and 1991. The collection also includes one box of miscellaneous index cards that do not refer to Ford Foundation grant-related publications but to other types of Ford Foundation publications and holdings. Many of the cards are protected in plastic sleeves labelled "Archives". The Ford Foundation Archives likely helped in the creation, assembly, and organization of the collection. </p><p>
The grant-related publication index cards are organized by four different arrangement schemes: 1) By the author(s) of the publication; 2) By the title of the publication; 3) By the Program Action (PA) number associated with the publication; and 4) By the Library of Congress Subject Heading applied to the publication in its bibliographic description. The publications they describe are associated with Ford Foundation grants PA50 – PA91. Ford Foundation grant files can be found in the Ford Foundation records, Grants collection <extref xlink:href="../FA732/overview">(FA732)</extref>.</p><p>
Not all index cards possess the same level of description. Some only have titles, authors, and PA Numbers while others include the extensive amount of bibliographic data found on typical library catalog cards. More detailed cards have fields such as date, physical description, Library of Congress Classification Number, subject, and publisher. The disparities in level of description between cards help explain why the collection possesses such a small number of cards arranged by subject in comparison to cards arranged by the other three organization systems. Cards that refer to books and articles are more likely to possess higher levels of bibliographic description than those that refer to smaller reports.</p><p>
Some of the miscellaneous index cards in Series 5 refer to publications and holdings from specific Ford Foundation programs and departments. Different groups of cards describe publications from The Fund for the Advancement of Education (TFAE), the Energy Policy Project (EPP), and the Ford Foundation Office of Reports respectively. While most of the publications and reports referenced in the series are not grant-related, some cards describing the TFAE and EPP holdings do include PA numbers. It can therefore be assumed that the associated publications are grant-related. Moreover, it should be noted that some index cards labelled TFAE and EPP are found within the first four series.</p><p>
The fifth series also contains index cards that describe a number of interviews from the Ford Foundation Oral History Project as well as other cards that describe a group of annual reports from various Ford Foundation field offices. The referenced oral history interviews can be found in the Ford Foundation records, Oral History Project collection <extref xlink:href="../FA618/overview">(FA618)</extref>.</p><p>
Some index cards note whether or not a publication or a section of a publication has been microfilmed. A few filing errors likely occurred within the collection before its ingestion by the RAC.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The Ford Foundation was chartered by Henry and Edsel Ford in 1936 "to receive and administer funds for scientific, educational and charitable purposes, all for the public welfare", and initially served the Ford family's charitable interests in the Detroit area. Following the deaths of Edsel Ford (1943) and Henry Ford (1947), the Foundation was propelled to the forefront of philanthropy as the largest American foundation in terms of both endowment and yearly expenditures, and with an international scope to its major program areas.</p> <p>During the Foundation's first twenty years its major programs were in international economic development, primary and higher education, educational and public broadcasting, behavioral sciences, civil liberties, urban development, fine arts and the humanities. The Ford Foundation also partnered with the Rockefeller Foundation in supporting agricultural development in South America, Africa, and Southeast Asia. Since the 1970s, the Foundation has also pioneered programs in women's rights, energy policy, micro-financing in under-developed countries, establishing human rights groups, and improving international HIV/AIDS education.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Immediate Source of Acquisition</head>
<p>Ford Foundation archive was deposited at RAC in 2011. Ford Foundation records, correspondence, reports, program files and officers papers were transferred to, and accessioned by, RAC beginning in 2011. Accessions continue as necesary.</p><p>
This material was transferred to RAC in 2015 by the Ford Foundation and ingested by the RAC as Accession 2015:092. </p>  </acqinfo>

    <head>Arrangement</head>
<p>The collection consists of five series. The first four series represent the four original systems of arrangement imposed by the records' creators. Series 1 contains the index cards arranged by author, Series 2 contains the index cards arranged by title, Series 3 contains the index cards arranged by Program Action (PA) Number, and Series 4 contains the index cards arranged by subject.</p><p>
The fifth series contains miscellaneous cards that were sent with the Ford Foundation grant-related publications but actually refer to other Ford Foundation holdings and publications. This series only encompasses one box but includes several subsections. Each subsection correspondences to the entity or type of holdings that its index cards describe.</p><p>
Index cards in Series 1, 2, and 4 are arranged in alphabetical order while the index cards in Series 3 are arranged in numerical order. Most of the index cards in Series 5 are arranged in alphabetical order, by either title or author.</p><p>
Collection arrangement is as follows:</p><p>
1. Cards arranged by author</p><p>
2. Cards arranged by title</p><p>
3. Cards arranged by Program Action (PA) Number</p><p>
4. Cards arranged by subject</p><p>
5. Miscellaneous cards</p>  </arrangement>

Index cards are ordered alphabetically by the publication author's last name.</p><p>
The index cards in this series generally record the publication author's name at the top along with the Program Action (PA) number associated with the publication's grant. Publication title follows below the author's name, and if a card contains more detailed bibliographic information, that description will generally be typed either in the same place as the title or below it. Index cards that reference publications with more than one author sometimes list additional authors below the first.</p><p>
Author name can refer to either an individual person or an organization. Author arranged index cards only provide bibliographic data for a single publication entry. Multiple index cards are used to individually represent the works of authors who have produced more than one publication.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ebb0c4b2bfc1c5679473f7e8f6a35d46" level="file"><did><unittitle>A -

The index cards in this series generally recod the PA Number at the top along with the name of the publication author. Publication title follows below the author's name, and if a card contains more detailed bibliographic information, that description will generally be typed either in the same place as the title or below it.</p><p>
The first box in the series (PA50 – PA54-19, Box 38) contains a few index cards that do not have PA numbers and instead appear to be arranged by Project Number. Project Numbers refer to project proposals.</p><p>
Series contains less index cards for grants initiated in later years. This may be because the publications for those grants had not yet been published by the time the index card collection had been created and compiled. Rather than PA numbers, some index cards possess seven digit ("000-0000") numbers towards the end of the series.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_eb40f830c81c53f1049f5842c09bd89d" level="file"><did><unittitle>PA50 - PA54-19</unittitle><container altrender="3 x 5 Card File Box" id="aspace_b6b68ba06ed2d617775a41324dcf4189" label="Mixed Materials [A0000000081388]" type="box">38</container></did></c><c id="aspace_c0eeb97341f2c487f5128145c24f3c36" level="file"><did><unittitle>PA54-20 - PA55</unittitle><container altrender="3 x 5 Card File Box" id="aspace_3fb208ef794f88e4cc0ba89617992640" label="Mixed Materials [A0000000081389]" type="box">39</container></did></c><c id="aspace_52f8c01e830f3d6c8015757f9d7ee263" level="file"><did><unittitle>PA56 - PA56-236</unittitle><container altrender="3 x 5 Card File Box" id="aspace_fcb3aea59288144a3eb5cf9b1a577f5a" label="Mixed Materials [A0000000081390]" type="box">40</container></did></c><c id="aspace_c3f365fe10a323d08c715ba2404f21b1" level="file"><did><unittitle>PA56-237 - PA57-229</unittitle><container altrender="3 x 5 Card File Box" id="aspace_baa6fca8d6ef0b1edbfc4fb860ca6539" label="Mixed Materials [A0000000081391]" type="box">41</container></did></c><c id="aspace_31ec992c7fe075c32f4986adad6124db" level="file"><did><unittitle>PA57-230 - PA58-295</unittitle><container altrender="3 x 5 Card File Box" id="aspace_6aa1bc79f5812430ace6b808cd04fa0f" label="Mixed Materials [A0000000081392]" type="box">42</container></did></c><c id="aspace_200f9be1e61a503f5fa2a753cd717025" level="file"><did><unittitle>PA58-300 - PA59-346</unittitle><container altrender="3 x 5 Card File Box" id="aspace_d3a6a5965120b7ab9addea3a95c37ecb" label="Mixed Materials [A0000000081393]" type="box">43</container></did></c><c id="aspace_e1abc20332eabad6db96c83ecc5f2832" level="file"><did><unittitle>PA59-347 - PA60</unittitle><container altrender="3 x 5 Card File Box" id="aspace_03d7e32b33ab75b457165a1d1c86f077" label="Mixed Materials [A0000000081394]" type="box">44</container></did></c><c id="aspace_acdd3653a57f510f6e69b045a9412107" level="file"><did><unittitle>PA61 - PA62</unittitle><container altrender="3 x 5 Card File Box" id="aspace_01f417bf2a6b9ff536295128bf317098" label="Mixed Materials [A0000000081395]" type="box">45</container></did></c><c id="aspace_5f0858a9c99ec0e51ccf72c02545a714" level="file"><did><unittitle>PA63 - PA65</unittitle><container altrender="3 x 5 Card File Box" id="aspace_8e7aeb0d743440194b9f7c795710500e" label="Mixed Materials [A0000000081396]" type="box">46</container></did></c><c id="aspace_a516bd039e8f4ac12d57fc11a83b0bbb" level="file"><did><unittitle>PA66 - PA68</unittitle><container altrender="3 x 5 Card File Box" id="aspace_6f1b88197948adf413c3e0d8e0208a90" label="Mixed Materials [A0000000081397]" type="box">47</container></did></c><c id="aspace_9b2cdbc40fd5531f5a7c7bc040a0f0b5" level="file"><did><unittitle>PA69 - PA72</unittitle><container altrender="3 x 5 Card File Box" id="aspace_6649ac7d6aac57dc9d550a69d90061c2" label="Mixed Materials [A0000000081398]" type="box">48</container></did></c><c id="aspace_06e92744ba01ad99f1dc09b2dda6e74d" level="file"><did><unittitle>PA73 - PA75</unittitle><container altrender="3 x 5 Card File Box" id="aspace_6fe15d081dec50f41fd89ca2574f741b" label="Mixed Materials [A0000000081399]" type="box">49</container></did></c><c id="aspace_d654587414f7314b06c39b223e1c445f" level="file"><did><unittitle>PA76 - PA79</unittitle><container altrender="3 x 5 Card File Box" id="aspace_646f04a37f954bf448f7b07a537bcb72" label="Mixed Materials [A0000000081400]" type="box">50</container></did></c><c id="aspace_01f70606275188e9e1d1e0e2386cea48" level="file"><did><unittitle>PA80 - PA91</unittitle><container altrender="3 x 5 Card File Box" id="aspace_4d551b840704df66713034e7fa0275bf" label="Mixed Materials [A0000000081695]" type="box">51</container></did></c></c><c id="aspace_74a4f891fb69e4b8a9e4fb4a6cff8667" level="series"><did><unittitle>Cards arranged by subject</unittitle><unitid>4</unitid><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">.417 Cubic Feet</extent><extent altrender="carrier">3 3x5 file card boxes</extent></physdesc></did><scopecontent id="aspace_32824adc17c13dd83447c0746d4ec57c"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Series contains the portion of Ford Foundation grant-related publication index cards that are arranged by subject term. Within the filing system imposed by the index cards' creators, subject terms were based on the Library of Congress Subject Headings system (LCSH). </p><p>
Index cards in this series generally record the LCSH term applied to the publication at the top along with the Program Action (PA) Number associated with the publication's grant. Publication title or author follows below with additional bibliographic data included close to one or both of those entries.</p><p>
Knowledge of LCSH terms and structuring conventions will help researches use the index cards in this series. Researchers are advised that not all subjects found within the series are still maintained by the LCSH system. For example, some cards have the term "Negroes" as part of their subjects. LCSH no longer uses the term Negroes to refer to African Americans.</p><p>
Subject arranged cards only provide bibliographic data for a single publication entry. However, some subjects are represented by more than one card in the series in order to provide access to multiple publications filed under the same LCSH term.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_0184d67e6ff152cc6982e1c0e02f52bc" level="file"><did><unittitle>A - E</unittitle><container altrender="3 x 5 Card File Box" id="aspace_6997c266232885ff7b624b5e111be297" label="Mixed Materials [A0000000081696]" type="box">52</container></did></c><c id="aspace_a2931554884a1b6d275931d17ef3d8f3" level="file"><did><unittitle>F - O</unittitle><container altrender="3 x 5 Card File Box" id="aspace_3df8e99fc9da2018aacd56806252916c" label="Mixed Materials [A0000000081697]" type="box">53</container></did></c><c id="aspace_341fa20612796de87791b5130e80cfac" level="file"><did><unittitle>P - Z</unittitle><container altrender="3 x 5 Card File Box" id="aspace_b15edff6cfb11d54425bdcd86b07d6ee" label="Mixed Materials [A0000000081698]" type="box">54</container></did></c></c><c id="aspace_2778ee54df20b66ba17d94866b2fff6a" level="series"><did><unittitle>Miscellaneous index cards</unittitle><unitid>5</unitid><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">.139 Cubic Feet</extent><extent altrender="carrier">1 3x5 card file box</extent></physdesc></did><scopecontent id="aspace_9966aeab6e131e71a6b0d9d24bcf1ab8"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Series chiefly contains index cards for non-grant-related Ford Foundation publications and holdings. The series is broken into several subsections, and each subsection contains the index cards for a specific Ford Foundation program or type of holding. The subsections appear in this order: 1) The Fund for the Advancement of Education (TFAE), 2) The Oral History Project, 3) The Ford Foundation Office of Reports, 4) Field Office Status Reports, 5) The Energy Policy Project (EPP), 6) BAF, and 7) Staff Publications. While most of the publications and reports referenced in the series are not grant-related, some cards describing the TFAE and EPP holdings do include PA numbers. It can therefore be assumed that the associated publications are grant-related.</p><p>
Index cards within the TFAE, Office of Reports, and EPP subsections are arranged by title while index cards within the Field Office Status Reports subsection are arranged by author. The index cards within all four of these subsections primarily describe publications or reports unlike the index cards within the Oral History Project subsection which describe various interviews concerning the history of the Ford Foundation. The Oral History Project was initiated in 1971 for the purpose of collecting a historical account of the Foundation's organization and programs for future analysis. Oral history index cards within the series are arranged by the names of the people interviewed for the project. Significant Ford Foundation figures like Henry Ford II and McGeorge Bundy are represented. All cards describe the date when an interview audio recording would be available for use. Additionally, some cards include the date and time of when the interview took place as well as the number of associated transcript pages. The oral history interviews can be found in the Ford Foundation records, Oral History Project collection <extref xlink:href="../FA618/overview">(FA618)</extref>.</p><p>
Limited information could be discovered about the last two subsections in the series. Only two index cards were found in the BAF subsection, and none were found in Staff Publications subsection.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_05523a376df90f5f2d2ecb7d121b29b2" level="file"><did><unittitle>Other Ford Foundation holdings</unittitle><container altrender="3 x 5 Card File Box" id="aspace_ea0f692a7e87c00b9e8b170d82e943d8" label="Mixed Materials [A0000000081699]" type="box">55</container></did></c></c></dsc>
