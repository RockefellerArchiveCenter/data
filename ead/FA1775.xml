<p>Series 7 of Record Group 3 consists of 6 subseries. </p><p>Series arrangement is as follows: </p><p>Subseries 7.1. Joint Committee on Japanese Studes (JCJS) program files, 1946-1995 </p><p>Subseries 7.2 Joint Committee on Korean Studies (JCKS) program files, 1945-1995 </p><p>Subseries 7.3 Joint Committee on Japanese Studies (JCJS) grant and fellowship awardees, 1984-1990 </p><p>Subseries 7.4 Joint Committee on Japanese Studies (JCJS) grant and fellowship declinations and withdrawals, 1968-1996 </p><p>Subseries 7.5 Joint Committee on Korean Studies (JCKS) grant and fellowship awardees, 1985-1996</p><p>Subseries 7.6 Joint Committee on Korean Studies (JCKS) grant and fellowship declinations and withdrawals, 1983-1996 </p><p>Records pertaining to the Social Science Research Council (SSRC) Japanese Studies and Korean Studies Programs were identified during a survey of various accessions of SSRC material. During processing, materials were arranged into different Japanese Studies and Korean Studies related subseries to reflect the different activities of the SSRC-American Council of Learned Societies (ACLS) Joint Committee on Japanese Studies (JCJS) and the Joint Committee on Korean Studies (JCKS). Additional groupings of records based on the content and purpose of the files were discovered during processing. </p><p>Files documenting JCJS and JCKS grant and fellowship applicants have been arranged into their own subseries with distinctions between files where applicants were awarded a grant or fellowship and files where applicants were not reflected in subseries assignments. The grant and fellowship files within Subseries 7.3 through 7.6 have been ordered by the year of the grant or fellowship award. </p><p>Remaining files documenting the activities of the JCJS and JCKS are arranged in the JCJS and JCKS program files subseries (Subseries 7.1 and 7.2.) As noted in the series scope and content note, because the JCJS and JCKS were managed by shared SSRC staff and were under the umbrella of the SSRC's programming for East Asia, there is some content overlap between the JCJS and JCKS program files in Subseries 7.1 and 7.2.</p>  </arrangement>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>Series 7 of the Social Science Research Council (SSRC) Record Group 3 contains the files of the SSRC's Japanese Studies and Korean Studies Programs. These programs were focused around the Joint Committee on Japanese Studies (JCJS) and the Joint Committee on Korean Studies (JCKS) which the SSRC operated with the American Council of Learned Societies (ACLS) from 1967 to 1996. Different subseries in the series document the activities of both joint committees. </p><p>Management of the JCJS and JCKS were shared by some of the same SSRC staff members, and both committees were part of the SSRC's programming for East Asia. Therefore, some content overlap occurs between the JCJS subseries and the JCKS subseries, and some files pertain to larger concerns of the East Asia program. </p><p>A large number of files in the series pertain to individual applicants to the various grant and fellowship programs of the JCJS and JCKS. There are different subseries for applicants who received awards and for applicants who did not. There are gaps for certain award years in the different subseries. The individual grant and fellowship files primarily originate from between the 1980s and the end of the JCJS and JCKS programs in 1996. </p><p>The grant and fellowship programs are also discussed in the JCJS and JCKS program files subseries which contain the bulk of the series' content. Other topics discussed within the subseries include committee administration, meetings, and membership, collaboration with other organizations involved in the Japanese Studies and Korean Studies fields, funding and grants for the committees, the committees' Regional Seminar Programs, committee supported research conferences, conference publications, and special points of interest like North Korea. </p><p>SSRC program staff who managed and supported the JCJS and JCKS as Staff Associates, Program Assistants, and Program Directors include Mary Bryne McDonnell, Ronald Aqua, Theodore Bestor, Stefan Tanaka, Blair Ruble, Monique Carroll, Yasmine Ergas, Elizabeth O'Brien, Dee Warren, Susan Pharr, Sophie Sa, Sheri Rains, Terry MacDougall, Raquel Ovryn Rivera, and Mimi Kim. They all contributed to the creation and management of the documents in the series. </p><p>Common material formats found throughout the series include correspondence, drafts, notes, proposals and application materials, reports, conference papers, meeting agendas, meeting minutes, invoices and other expense records, agreements and contracts, articles, newsletters, and publications.</p>  </scopecontent>

<p>Established in 1967, the Social Science Reseach Council's Joint Committee on Japanese Studies (JCJS) strived to organize and initiate research on Japan and advance the Japanese Studies academic field in the United States.  The JCJS was the joint work of the SSRC and the American Council of Learned Societies (ACLS) and fit into the SSRC's larger programming for East Asia area studies. SSRC closed the JCJS program in 1996. </p><p>The JCJS provided various grant and fellowship programs for doctoral and postdoctoral research related to Japanese studies. It also supported a Regional Seminar Program which brought together scholars in various areas around the country who were not near a major Japanese Studies research center and other Japanese Studies research projects, conferences, and publications. </p><p>The JCJS collaborated with other organizations interested in Japanese Studies like the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), the International House of Japan, the Japan Foundation, and the Japan-United States Friendship Commission (JUSFC). </p><p>The JCJS and the Joint Committee on Korean Studies (JCKS) were directed by the same SSRC staff.</p>  </bioghist>

Meeting files contain correspondence, agendas, notes, and minutes documenting meeting planning and preparation, proceedings, and follow-up activities. </p><p>Files show that the JCKS sought and received grant funding from organizations like the Henry Luce Foundation, the Korea Foundation, and the Korea Research Foundation. </p><p>Whereas grant and fellowship files in Subseries 7.5 and 7.6 concern individual applicants, files pertaining to the JCKS grants and fellowship programs in this subseries document planning, funding, and decisions for award years at large.  </p><p>Another area of focus for the JCKS outside of its grants and fellowship programs was the Regional Seminar Program. Files concerning these seminars document their administration and meetings. Additionally, there are files documenting the preparation and proceedings of the various research conferences, projects, and publications the JCKS supported. Because most of the research with which the JCKS engaged pertained to South Korea (Republic of Korea (ROK)), the JCKS had a significant interest in developing more knowledge around North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)).</p></scopecontent><c id="a518af13ba6da746e82ad5299c83127b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Wilson Center Report on Korean Studies</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1988/1990" type="inclusive">1988-1990</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="8edfcddd1aa3c8f4688d1ede1c873043" label="mixed materials [A0000000121851]" type="box">37</container><container id="36f8ecd7d9a1dac1f7d1babc6cf9f16c" parent="8edfcddd1aa3c8f4688d1ede1c873043" type="folder">398</container></did></c><c id="a8ea5094c4d96f32a69e0d3f56321103" level="file"><did><unittitle>Joint Advisory Committee on International Programs (JACIP) report -

Most of the applicants were declined acceptance by the JCJS, some were initially designated as alternates but were then declined, and some were awarded a grant or fellowship but then withdrew, mostly because they received grant support from other sources. As the contents of the subseries demonstrates, the subseries does not hold the files for all declinations of these programs. The award years documented within the subseries originate from the early 1970s and then span from the mid 1980s to the end of JCJS in 1996 with some gaps within that time span. The grant and fellowship programs the JCJS administered which the subseries documents include: </p><p>- Dissertation Write-Up Fellowship for pre-doctoral researchers </p><p>- Advanced Research Grant for post-doctoral researchers </p><p>- Research Planning Grant </p><p>- Dissertation Workshop </p><p>Files include the applicant's research proposal and accompanying application materials as well as the declination letter from the JCJS. Some files include other documents like additional correspondence. </p><p>Applicants documented within the subseries sought to research such subject areas as economics, international trade, economic development, labor, industry, religion, Buddhism, culture, art, literature, film, linguistics, law, politics, nationalism, international relations, history, anthropology, gender, women, education, child development, family studies, sociology, psychology, criminology, sexuality, and technology in relation to Japan.</p><p>Files are arranged chronologically by the award program year, and within those chronological groupings, the files have been arranged according to what award program they pertain.</p></scopecontent><c id="bdcf5da2697c46b0cee3ef55e2fb5493" level="file"><did><unittitle>Joint Committee on Japanese Studies (JCJS) Grant 1972-1974 declinations</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1968/1973" type="inclusive">1968-1973</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="6e05d2f18ab77b1e1a4892968dbe00db" label="mixed materials [A0000000123017]" type="box">64</container><container id="0c65f985b9ac5325f6c32f2cc94515c2" parent="6e05d2f18ab77b1e1a4892968dbe00db" type="folder">652</container></did><accessrestrict id="f6bf0cff4b9b934a4b439164aa9fd1f6"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>Restricted – confidential material</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="158aab292a780f7a0c95a6aa26a44d25" level="file"><did><unittitle>Joint Committee on Japanese Studies (JCJS) Advanced Research Grant 1984-1985 declinations -

Most of the applicants were declined acceptance by the JCKS, some were initially designated as alternates but were then declined, and some were awarded a grant or fellowship but then withdrew, mostly because they received grant support from other sources. As the contents of the subseries demonstrates, the subseries does not hold the files for all declinations of these programs. The award years documented within the subseries originate from a time span between the mid-1980s and 1990 and then from 1995 to 1996 when the JCKS ended. The grant and fellowship programs the JCKS administered which the subseries documents include: </p><p>- Dissertation Fellowship for pre-doctoral researchers </p><p>- Advanced Research Grant for post-doctoral researchers </p><p>- Research Planning Grant </p><p>Files include the applicant's research proposal and accompanying application materials as well as the declination letter from the JCKS. Some files include other documents like additional correspondence. </p><p>Applicants documented within the subseries researched such subject areas as economics, economic development, international trade, labor, politics, sociology, child development, gender, women, culture, music, literature, linguistics, religion, history, and education in relation to Korea (particularly South Korea/Republic of Korea (ROK)). </p><p>Files are arranged chronologically by the award program year, and within those chronological groupings, the files have been arranged according to what award program they pertain.</p></scopecontent><c id="755c82186d0a0ed134e8e5828086d94d" level="file"><did><unittitle>Joint Committee on Korean Studies (JCKS) Advanced Research Grant 1985-1986 declinations -
