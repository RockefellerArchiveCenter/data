    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The Near East Foundation (NEF) traces its history to 1915 when prominent New Yorkers formed the "Committee for Armenian and Syrian Relief" to raise money for Armenian, Syrian, Greek and other refugees from the Ottoman Empire. Chartered by the U.S. Congress in 1919 as "Near East Relief," the organization was designated as the primary channel for U.S. postwar aid in the region. It undertook major nationwide campaigns to raise funds for its relief work and operated orphanages and other relief agencies in the region. In 1930 the organization was reorganized as the Near East Foundation and altered its focus from providing relief to providing technical assistance in agriculture and public health in rural communities. In American Philanthropy Abroad (1963), Merle Curti argues that "no agency did such effective pioneering in the improvement of community life as a whole and in developing the total personality of its inhabitants as the Near East Foundation did in 48 Macedonian villages in the 1930s and in its postwar programs in Syria, Eritrea, Iran and other countries." The foundation's technical assistance work influenced both President Truman's Point Four program and several U.N. operations. In 1964 the NEF expanded its geographic range of activity into Africa. While the NEF has been most closely identified in the public's mind with Armenian relief and some early material in the collection does relate to this early work, the bulk of the material in the collection deals with the NEF's global technical assistance programs after 1930.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Arrangement</head>
<p>Arranged in six record groups, each comprised of multiple series. The record groups and associated series numbers are primarily representative of when the materials were transferred to RAC, and do not imply an original order of the records. Several of the record groups are organized by record type. Within series, records are maintained in original order as received. Additional finding aids are created as records are processed and open for research.</p>  </arrangement>

    <head>Immediate Source of Acquisition</head>
<p>The Near East Foundation records were donated to the Rockefeller Archive Center by NEF in June 2011.  </p><p>The initial short-term deposit of the NEF records was adopted in 2009, at which time all the NEF records onsite at RAC were comprehensively accessioned as 2009:104 (approx. 149 cu. ft). Additional materials have been sporadically received and accessioned accordingly.</p><p>RAC obtained physical custody of the initial tranche of NEF records on March 3, 2005. Much of the material transferred to RAC in 2005 arrived in the original metal filing cabinets, and was subsequently re-housed into archival storage boxes. Transfers of records from NEF continue periodically.</p>  </acqinfo>
