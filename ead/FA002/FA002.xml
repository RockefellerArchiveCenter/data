    <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
<p>John Davison Rockefeller (July 8, 1839 - May 23, 1937) was the guiding force behind the creation and development of the Standard Oil Company, which grew to dominate the oil industry and became one of the first big trusts in the United States, thus engendering much controversy and opposition regarding its business practices and form of organization. Rockefeller was also one of the first major philanthropists in the U.S., establishing several important foundations and donating a total of $540 million to charitable purposes.</p><p> Rockefeller was born on a farm at Richford, in Tioga County, New York, on July 8, 1839, the second of the six children of William A. and Eliza (Davison) Rockefeller. The family lived in modest circumstances. When he was a boy, the family moved to Moravia and later to Owego, New York, before going west to Ohio in 1853. The Rockefellers bought a house in Strongsville, near Cleveland, and John entered Central High School in Cleveland. While he was a student he rented a room in the city and joined the Erie Street Baptist Church, which later became the Euclid Avenue Baptist Church. Active in its affairs, he became a trustee of the church at the age of 21.</p><p> He left high school in 1855 to take a business course at Folsom Mercantile College. He completed the six-month course in three months and, after looking for a job for six weeks, was employed as assistant bookkeeper by Hewitt &amp; Tuttle, a small firm of commission merchants and produce shippers. Rockefeller was not paid until after he had worked there three months, when Hewitt gave him $50 ($3.57 a week) and told him that his salary was being increased to $25 a month. A few months later he became the cashier and bookkeeper.</p><p> In 1859, with $1,000 he had save and another $1,000 borrowed from his father, Rockefeller formed a partnership in the commission business with another young man, Maurice B. Clark. In that same year the first oil well was drilled at Titusville in western Pennsylvania, giving rise to the petroleum industry. Cleveland soon became a major refining center of the booming new industry, and in 1863 Rockefeller and Clark entered the oil business as refiners. Together with a new partner, Samuel Andrews, who had some refining experience, they built and operated an oil refinery under the name of Andrews, Clark &amp; Co. The firm also continued in the commission business but in 1865 the partners, now five in number, disagreed about the management of their business affairs and decided to sell the refinery to whoever amongst them bid the highest. Rockefeller bought it for $72,500, sold out his other interests, and with Andrews, formed Rockefeller &amp; Andrews.</p><p> THE STANDARD OIL COMPANY</p><p> Rockefeller's stake in the oil industry increased as the industry itself expanded, spurred by the rapidly spreading use of kerosene for lighting. In 1870 he organized The Standard Oil Company along with his brother William, Andrews, Henry M. Flagler, S.V. Harkness, and others. It had a capital of $1 million.</p><p> By 1872 Standard Oil had purchased and thus controlled nearly all the refining firms in Cleveland, plus two refineries in the New York City area. Before long the company was refining 29,000 barrels of crude oil a day and had its own cooper shop manufacturing wooden barrels. The company also had storage tanks with a capacity of several hundred thousand barrels of oil, warehouses for refined oil, and plants for the manufacture of paints and glue.</p><p> Standard prospered and, in 1882, all its properties were merged in the Standard Oil Trust, which was in effect one great company. It had an initial capital of $70 million. There were originally forty-two certificate holders, or owners, in the trust.</p><p> After ten years the trust was dissolved by a court decision in Ohio. The companies that had made up the trust later joined in the formation of the Standard Oil Company (New Jersey), since New Jersey adopted a law that permitted a parent company to own the stock of other companies. It is estimated that Standard Oil owned three-fourths of the petroleum business in the U.S. in the 1890s.</p><p> In addition to being the head of Standard, Rockefeller owned iron mines and timberland and invested in numerous companies in manufacturing, transportation, and other industries. Although he held the title of president of Standard Oil until 1911, Rockefeller retired from active leadership of the company in 1896. In 1911 the U.S. Supreme Court found the Standard Oil trust to be in violation of the anti-trust laws and ordered the dissolution of the parent New Jersey corporation. The thirty-eight companies which it then controlled were separated into individual firms. In his biography, Study in Power, John D. Rockefeller, Industrialist and Philanthropist, the historian Allan Nevins reports that Rockefeller at that time owned 244,500 of the company's total of 983,383 outstanding shares.</p><p> PHILANTHROPY</p><p> Rockefeller was 57 years old in 1896 when he decided that others should take over the day-to-day leadership of Standard Oil. He now focused his efforts on philanthropy, giving away the bulk of his fortune in ways designed to do the most good as determined by careful study, experience and the help of expert advisers.</p><p> From the time he had begun earning money as a boy, he had been giving a share of his income to his church and charities. His philanthropy grew out of his early family training, religious convictions, and financial habits. "I believe it is every man's religious duty to get all he can honestly and to give all he can," he once wrote. During the 1850s, he made regular contributions to the Baptist church, and by the time he was 21, he was giving not only to his own but to other denominations, as well as to a foreign Sunday school and an African-American church. Support of religious institutions and African-American education remained among his foremost philanthropic interests throughout his life.</p><p> THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO</p><p> As his wealth grew in the 1870s and 1880s, Rockefeller came to favor a cooperative and conditional system of giving in which he would agree to supply part of the sum needed for a particular project if the others interested in it also would provide substantial financial support. It was on such a conditional basis that Rockefeller participated in the founding of the University of Chicago. The American Baptist Education Society had resolved in 1889 to establish a "well-equipped college" in Chicago. At the urging of the society's director, the Rev. Frederick T. Gates, Rockefeller offered to give $600,000 of the first $1 million for endowment, provided the remaining $400,000 was pledged by others within 90 days. Thus begun, the University of Chicago was incorporated in 1890, and over the next twenty years Rockefeller contributed to help build up the institution, always on condition that others should join in its support. In 1910 he made a farewell gift of $10 million, which brought his total contributions to the university to about $35 million. In withdrawing from further activity, he wrote: "I am acting on an early and permanent conviction that this great institution, being the property of the people, should be controlled, conducted and supported by the people."</p><p> CORPORATE PHILANTHROPY</p><p> Rockefeller recognized the difficulties of wisely applying great funds to human welfare, and he helped to define the method of scientific, efficient, corporate philanthropy. The method was this: to create charitable corporations and give them title to great funds, whose management and use would be governed by trustees and overseen by officers with specialized training and experience, with both the trustees and officers being dedicated to continuous study of the opportunities for the best uses of the funds under their care. To help manage his philanthropy, Rockefeller hired the Rev. Frederick T. Gates, whose work with the American Baptist Education Society and the University of Chicago inspired Rockefeller's confidence. With the advice of Gates and, after 1897, his son, John D. Rockefeller, Jr., Rockefeller established a series of institutions that are important in the history of American philanthropy, science, and medicine and public health.</p><p> THE ROCKEFELLER INSTITUTE FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH</p><p> In 1901 he founded the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research (now The Rockefeller University) for the purpose of discovering the causes, manner of prevention, and the cure of disease. From its laboratories have come cures for diseases, and new knowledge and scientific techniques which have helped to revolutionize medicine, biology, biochemistry, biophysics and other scientific disciplines. A few of the noted achievements of its scientists are the serum treatment of spinal meningitis and of pneumonia; knowledge of the cause and manner of infection in infantile paralysis; the nature of the virus causing epidemic influenza; blood vessel surgery; a treatment for African sleeping sickness; the first demonstration of the preservation of whole blood for subsequent transfusion; the first demonstration of how nerve cells flow from the brain to other areas of the body; the discovery that a virus can cause cancer in fowl; peptide synthesis; and identification of DNA as the crucial genetic material.</p><p> THE GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD (1902-1965)</p><p> In 1902 Rockefeller established the General Education Board (GEB) for the "promotion of education within the United States of America without the distinction of race, sex or creed." In its active years between 1902 and 1965, the GEB distributed $325 million for the improvement of education at all levels, with emphasis upon higher education, including medical schools. In the South, where there was special need, the GEB helped schools for both white and African-American students. Also, out of the Board's work with children's clubs in the farm arena grew the 4-H Club movement and the federal programs of farm and home extension.</p><p> ROCKEFELLER SANITARY COMMISSION (1909-1915)</p><p> In 1909 Rockefeller combined his special interest in the South and his interest in public health with the creation of the Rockefeller Sanitary Commission for the Eradication of Hookworm Disease. Its purpose was "to bring about a cooperative movement of the medical profession, public health officials, boards of trade, churches, schools, the press, and other agencies for the cure and prevention of hookworm disease," which was especially devastating in the South. From its headquarters in Washington, D.C., the Sanitary Commission launched a massive campaign of public education and medication in eleven Southern states. It paid the salaries of field personnel, who were appointed jointly by the states and the Commission, and sponsored public education campaigns and the treatment of infected persons. As part of this program, more than 25,000 public meetings were attended by more than 2 million people who were given the facts about hookworm and its prevention. So successful was its work that a new agency was created as part of a new Rockefeller philanthropy to expand the work to other countries and to attack other diseases both in the South and abroad.</p><p> THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION</p><p> In 1913 Rockefeller established the Rockefeller Foundation (RF) to "promote the well-being of mankind throughout the world." In keeping with this broad commitment, the Foundation through the years has given important assistance to public health, medical education, increasing food production, scientific advancement, social research, the arts, and other fields all over the world. </p><p> The Foundation's International Health Division expanded the work of the Sanitary Commission worldwide, working against various diseases in fifty-two countries on six continents and twenty-nine islands, bringing international recognition of the need for public health and environmental sanitation. Its early field research on hookworm, malaria and yellow fever provided the basic techniques to control these diseases and established the pattern of modern public health services. The RF built and endowed the world's first School of Hygiene and Public Health, at The Johns Hopkins University, and then spent over $25 million in developing public health schools in the U.S. and in twenty-one foreign countries. Its agricultural development program in Mexico led to what has been called the Green Revolution in the advancement of food production around the world; and the RF provided significant funding for the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines. Thousands of scientists and scholars from all over the world have received RF fellowships and scholarships for advanced study. The foundation helped to found the Social Science Research Council and has provided significant support for such organizations as the National Bureau for Economic Research, the Brookings Institution, the Council on Foreign Relations, and Russian Institute at Columbia University. In the arts the RF has helped establish or support the Stratford Shakespearean Festival in Ontario, Canada, and the American Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Connecticut; Arena Stage in Washington, D.C.; Karamu House in Cleveland; and Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York.</p><p> OTHER ROCKEFELLER PHILANTHROPIC SUPPORT</p><p> In addition to creating these corporate philanthropies, Rockefeller continued to make personal donations. Among others whose activities received his financial support were various colleges and universities, including Yale, Harvard, Columbia, Brown, Spelman, Bryn Mawr, Wellesley, and Vassar; theological schools; the Palisades Interstate Park Commission; San Francisco Earthquake victims; the Anti-Saloon League; Rockefeller Park and other parks in Cleveland; Baptist missionary organizations; and various YMCAs and YWCAs.</p><p> FAMILY LIFE</p><p> John D. Rockefeller and Laura C. Spelman (1839-1915), a teacher, were married on September 8, 1864, in Cleveland. The Rockefellers had five children - four daughters and a son, John D. Rockefeller, Jr. (1874-1960), who inherited much of the family fortune and continued his father's philanthropic work. Their eldest daughter, Bessie (1866-1906), married Charles Strong. Their second daughter, Alice (1869-1870), died in infancy. Alta (1871-1962) married E. Parmalee Prentice, and the youngest daughter, Edith (1872-1932), married Harold Fowler McCormick.</p><p> In the 1870s Rockefeller began to make business trips from Cleveland to New York. After a time he started bringing along his family for lengthy stays and, in 1884, he bought a large brownstone house at 4 West 54th Street, the land of which is now part of the garden of the Museum of Modern Art. Beginning in the 1890s, the family spent part of their time at Pocantico Hills, about 25 miles north of New York. For a number of years the Rockefellers returned during the summer to their Forest Hill home in East Cleveland. As he grew older, Rockefeller spent several months each year at his country homes in Lakewood, New Jersey, and Ormond Beach, Florida.</p><p> Rockefeller died on the morning of May 23, 1937, at The Casements, his home in Ormond Beach. He was 97 years old. He is buried in Lakeview Cemetery in Cleveland.</p>  </bioghist>

So successfully did he work, save, and give that he made the Rockefeller family and its manifold interests a central force in twentieth-century life. His work did much to revolutionize the business system. His vast savings and the need to invest them well placed him in the forefront of innovative money management. His giving occurred on a scale and in a manner that long afterwards kept the name Rockefeller at the center of philanthropy. Together, they made him one of the most influential figures in modern America. His wealth and power and the controversies over how he acquired them meant that he "was to spend most of his active years in grim fighting," as Allan Nevins wrote. "He was to be more widely hated, attacked and reviled than any other man of his generation."**</p><p> These papers offer a window through which we can observe the many ways in which power was gained and used in industrial society. And, despite the fact that these documents are now a century or more old, they depict a world that much resembles our own. At the same time, they remind us how and why such dizzying concentrations of wealth and influence called forth an accompanying hatred and envy. The story of John D. Rockefeller excites in Americans that curious mix of admiration and fear that we have long felt about big business.</p><p> These papers show America's pioneering giant industrial combination at work, but they do much more than that. They afford a remarkable view of the nation's social history and of the beginnings of modern philanthropy. Most of all, they reveal the sometimes hidden and convoluted ways of what later was called "the establishment"; Rockefeller simply called them "our people." Here those with influence formed and re-formed alliances, proposed and closed deals, exchanged favors, arranged the world. Seldom can we see so clearly as we can here into many of those private places where power worked its quiet ways.</p><p> It was the business achievement that led to all the other things the world now associates with the Rockefeller name, so it is important to understand briefly that fundamental part of the story. John D. Rockefeller stood at the center of the large and talented group of executives and managers who created the Standard Oil Company. Standard was the first American manufacturer to dominate a global market through the techniques of mass production and mass distribution. The railroads had pioneered in the creation of modern big business, but Rockefeller's Standard Oil was in the forefront as the western world's manufacturing sector also came to be dominated by giant enterprises. Standard was one of the nation's first great manufacturing businesses, and it became a leader in what has been one of the most lucrative industries in the history of the world. The money and power attached to oil have done much to shape the world for more than a century, and they continue to do so today.</p><p> Rockefeller got in on the ground floor. The world's first oil well was drilled in Titusville, in western Pennsylvania, in 1859. John D. Rockefeller had just turned twenty. Within a few years, however, the young Cleveland produce and commission merchant became an important figure in the infant oil trade. The industry was chaotic and risky, but its expansion was spectacular. In the year of the first well at Titusville, only two thousand barrels of crude oil were produced. In ten years, the volume of crude had shot up to almost five million barrels. The big product was not gasoline: the internal combustion engine and the automobile industry were still decades away. Instead, the industry's main product was illuminating oil (kerosene), and the world had a great need for a relatively cheap, reliable source of light. (Electric lighting, too, still lay in the future.) And for almost a quarter of a century, the United States was virtually the only important source of petroleum in the world. This meant that Americans had the opportunity to develop a substantial export business, building one of the first comprehensive global distribution networks and earning great rewards as a result. Within a couple of decades of its beginnings as an industry, refined petroleum had become one of the nation's leading exports.</p><p> When young Rockefeller entered the business he was a novice, only a face in a crowded cast of small entrepreneurs. He had begun in the business world in 1859 as a junior partner in a Cleveland wholesale grocery business with Maurice B. Clark. In 1863 he and Clark accepted the invitation of John Andrews to enter the new oil business as a sideline to their grocery trade, forming the firm of Andrews, Clark and Company. Within two years Rockefeller bought out Clark and gave his full attention to the thriving refining business, trading in refined petroleum as a partner in the firm of Rockefeller and Andrews. From that point on, more than any other person, he would shape the evolution of one of the industrial world's major lines of commerce.</p><p> The early oil industry was made up of many small-scale competitors. The individuals, partnerships, and companies that elbowed each other for position found themselves on a competitive roller coaster. It was not a terribly expensive proposition to enter the trade, which meant that profits were continually at risk and overproduction was a constant threat, since almost any number could play the game of oil. New oil fields were discovered periodically, and there was always a rush to produce as much crude oil from a field as possible. Prices fluctuated wildly; in 1864, for example, the price of a barrel of crude varied from four dollars to twelve dollars. The refineries, like the drilling rigs, were not very complicated or costly, so entry there was also easy. As in so many other industries involving the processing of plentiful natural raw materials, there were cycles of great boom and great bust. Since the final products sold for so much more than the raw material, it was an industry in which great riches could be earned, if only the problem of overproduction could be solved. It was in that arena that John D. Rockefeller had a special genius.</p><p> Almost from the beginning, the abilities and strategies that would give Rockefeller his great success were evident. He had a knack for inspiring confidence on the part of investors and lenders, and he had a flair for choosing exceptionally able associates. He had a belief in hard work and in the value of objective data for making business decisions that was almost as strong as his Baptist religious piety. In addition, from the first he believed in having the best, most efficient production facilities. And he had a sober ruthlessness rooted in an unwavering conviction in the rightness of what he was doing. It was in Cleveland that he first demonstrated his talent for turning oil into gold by turning chaos into order.</p><p> Perhaps the key to the success of Rockefeller's strategy was his realization that he and his partners could exploit the weakness of another industry, the railroads. Because the railroads that served Cleveland were caught in a particularly strong version of the cutthroat competition that plagued the entire rail sector, Rockefeller saw that he could whipsaw them. He played one against another, bargaining for transportation rates that were cheaper than his competitors'. As the highest-volume shipper in the Cleveland oil trade, Rockefeller could negotiate rates that gave his company cost advantages over others. Combined with his enlistment of large investors to keep his production facilities the largest and most efficient in the region, the results of the shipping advantages kept the Rockefeller firm on top in Cleveland. Soon he was able to persuade his hard-pressed regional competitors to merge with his company or to sell out to him, which made his business even more dominant in the area. In turn, this strengthened his power to influence production levels and prices. It seemed that a runaway industry might indeed be brought under more rational control. The Rockefeller strategy worked, and his various enterprises in Cleveland were combined in the late 1860s in the Standard Oil Company, which was then incorporated in 1870. By 1872 Standard had become virtually the only important firm in the region, thus completing what came to be called the "Conquest of Cleveland."</p><p> Like so many apparent solutions to competitive problems in the history of business, however, Rockefeller's triumph soon was clouded by the unwelcome reappearance of competition in the national market. Despite Standard's acquisition of the largest refinery in New York City, its subsequent closing of the older and less efficient Cleveland refineries, and the company's strong position in the overseas trade, the industry's old problems soon reasserted themselves. Overproduction, price wars, and falling profit margins quickly reappeared. As early as 1869 refiners and producers of crude had tried to negotiate peace and prosperity through agreements to be overseen by a variety of trade associations. These were loose alliances in which the independent members promised to behave themselves and maintain prices and output levels. Time and again, however, the agreements so solemnly negotiated were ignored and violated by one or another of the firms in the association. Because American common law was not sympathetic to such price-fixing and market-dividing schemes, the agreements did not have the force of contracts. The associations and their agreements were not yet illegal, but the courts would not offer any help in making the parties abide by their own plans and promises. Secret price cuts and rebates, as well as violations of set production levels, caused the familiar problem of severe competition to break out again and again. After repeated failures with the association approach, Rockefeller concluded that the associations were "ropes of sand." He then set out to forge something more reliable.</p><p> Standard expanded its share of the nation's refining capacity, continued to concentrate production in a few large refineries, and integrated into more and more aspects of the business, particularly in the new form of transporting oil, pipelines. Repeating the old Cleveland tactic of using his leverage to secure favorable railroad rates, Rockefeller aggressively pursued the consolidation of the industry into the Standard Oil Company. Through sharp competition and selective price wars against the uncooperative elements in the industry, Standard became by far the dominant oil firm in the country. From the late 1870s, Rockefeller's company had about nine-tenths of the refining capacity in the United States. To shore up its legal control over what had come to be a messy patchwork of allied firms and partially owned subsidiaries, Standard in 1882 became the first large American business to adopt the trust form of organization, in which a handful of individuals held the shares of all the allied and subsidiary firms "in trust" for all their owners. Further administrative consolidation followed.</p><p> It is at approximately this point in the story that the documents in the Correspondence series begin. The earliest ones in quantity are from 1887, and the latest from 1894. The great bulk of these manuscripts, however, cover the 1880s, a period when Standard Oil was at the height of its worldwide dominance of the oil industry. It was also a time when the great wealth produced by Rockefeller's work had reached dimensions that required much attention to its investment and to its careful stewardship through philanthropy. Though there is a scattering of outgoing correspondence and telegrams, almost all the material is incoming. Each of the three subseries in this series contains a potpourri of personal, business, and philanthropic concerns. This intermixing within the files is itself a testimony to the complex ways in which all those realms amplified and reinforced each other in John D. Rockefeller's life.</p><p> Here, then, are documents that show in high relief so many sides of life in the United States in the late nineteenth century. John D. Rockefeller and his associates stood at the center of so many of the great events of the era -- in business, in social history, in philanthropy, in politics, in religion, in education, and in the investment world. To read the papers is to see the workings of some of the richest and most powerful figures in an era when the United States was emerging as the leading industrial nation on the globe. We see ourselves and our modern world on these pages, and it is not always a pretty sight. But if we care to understand how institutions and influence work in America, there is hardly a better place to begin than in these documents.</p><p> Glenn Porter, Director, Hagley Museum and Library</p><p> * Nevins, Allan.

From all over the country and from around the world there flowed data, information, and rumor. Reports to the Executive Committee of Standard Oil showed how the firm dealt with the first really effective challenges to its international hegemony in the 1880s, the result of the discovery and exploitation of vast fields in Russia, developed by the Nobel interests. The task of keeping order in the industry was never-ending, as can be seen, for example, in the files from Standard executive John Archbold. The company's hold on the domestic transport of oil was threatened by a succession of competitors and opponents from time to time. For example, Archbold wrote to Rockefeller in 1886: "We learn today to our great surprise and disgust that Penna. RR is furnishing Tank cars to the Holdship pipe Line for shipment of crude oil East. Have telegraphed protest strongly."* Similarly, the international struggle required constant vigilance: "We are considering the question of sending somebody to the Far East . . . the Russians are making very aggressive efforts in these mkts."** By contrast, at moments when all was well within Standard's empire, Archbold could report what Rockefeller longed to hear: "pressing sales of refined in all directions as vigorously as possible. Everything moving along quietly and well."***</p><p> Equally important were the continuous summaries of quantitative data, the informational lifeblood of a modern business enterprise. Reports on stocks of crude oil, kerosene, and lubricants came constantly from New Jersey, from Marseilles, from the Far East, and from all over the world. Data on productivity and profitability were especially prevalent, such as reports on the monthly yields of various products per hundred gallons of crude in Standard's different refineries around the country, including conclusions about the total value of the product, the cost of refining, and the net value of goods produced at each site. No detail seemed to be too small to require at least a summary for the firm's head, including data on the monthly amounts paid to Western Union in Cleveland for telegrams. Information on insurance, news of competitors' new or rumored refineries or transportation facilities, measures of performance by individual managers or refineries, real estate deals, and political and legal intelligence were generated in staggering volume. Important moments in history are here, such as the telegram from Standard's lawyer and lobbyist in Washington that brought John D. Rockefeller word of Senate passage of the Sherman Antitrust Act. "Senate has just passed the Judiciary Committee trust bill all amendments being voted down," J. H. Flagg wired Rockefeller at his residence at 4 W. 54th Street in Manhattan in April of 1890. "There was but little debate and only one Senator Blodgett of New Jersey voted against the bill."**** A little more than twenty years later, that act would be used to break up Standard Oil in the landmark Supreme Court case of 1911.</p><p> In these voluminous business files we see also the communications to their leader from many of the able lieutenants and associates in Standard, such as John Archbold, Henry Flagler, and Henry Folger. Here, in short, we can see the details of how the great Standard Oil Trust did its work.</p><p>  Glenn Porter Director Hagley Museum and Library ----------------------------------- * Archbold to Rockefeller, October 5, 1886.

Rockefeller's fortune grew, it became a monumental task to keep the funds well invested. By the time the papers in this subseries begin, it was already a challenge that kept a large network of people busy. Good investment strikes a balance between risk and reward, and reliable information on the prospects for both elements in the equation was always difficult to acquire. As in all other walks of life, Rockefeller relied on networks of associates to see that his money went into promising investments. He retained strong ties to Cleveland long after Standard Oil moved to New York city, and his papers contain many communications from his home city about good opportunities there. G. M. Stafford of the Woodland Ave. Savings and Loan Co. in Cleveland was a frequent source of such reliable data. One of his letters is worth quoting in full to give a sense of the research that lay behind a good investment:</p><p>  We can offer you some of the best paper we have ever had @ 7% and secured by the best of Real Estate. One loan of $25,000 in two notes @ $17,500, &amp; $7500 due in one year and secured by Property on Euclid Ave, cor Dorchester, next to Dunham Ave 92 X 710, with good Brick House &amp; Barn (the old Marsh property). The property is owned by John W. Fox, who lives there--He lately married Mrs. Dunham. The property is worth fully $50,000. The 7,500 note is secured on property just purchased by Mr. Fox--consisting of 50 acres next adjoining N. O. Stone in Euclid Township, fronting on Euclid Ave--He paid $17,500 cash for it. The other is a loan of $50,000 in two notes of $25,000 each and secured by $70,000 of the Grasselli Chem. Co stock at par. The stock is worth $150 per share. It is owned by Thos. A. Ireland a brother in law of Mr. Grasselli. These people are among our best customers. The loans would be made direct to us and we will give our certificates for the money and give you the above as collateral--one year @ 7%. They wish the money and we are arranging to furnish it. We get no commissions or profits from it save their regular business.*</p><p> Opportunities to buy into good situations came regularly. Rockefeller took advantage, for example, of a chance in 1885 to buy 3,000 shares in another of the early trusts, American Cotton Oil.** There were many occasions when Rockefeller and his associates learned of promising stock market situations. These papers in fact give a revealing look at the process by which stocks and bonds were placed in the hands of those with funds to invest. They document the very era during which industrial stocks were beginning to be more widely traded, a critical development in the creation of more and more giant enterprises in manufacturing. In addition, they show in a dramatic fashion the fast and loose ways of Wall Street in the era before securities regulation. What we characterize today as insider trading was commonplace. Confidential word came to Rockefeller from the board meetings of many railroads, manufacturing corporations, utilities, and the like, reports of opportunities to take part in or to cause run-ups or declines in the prices of a wide variety of stocks. One Rockefeller associate who reported on such chances was J. F. Alexander, who sometimes dictated bulletins such as this one in April of 1888: "There will probably be a very sharp rise in Terminal Stock this afternoon . . . The chance has not come since the great contest for the stock a year ago last November. [Insiders on the Board] have all bought and the probability is it will go very high. These are the actual facts of the case. The street do[es] not know about it."*** With the advantages of the latest communications technology, his location in the heart of New York's financial district, substantial liquid funds to invest, and an unparalleled network of business connections, associates, and staff, John D. Rockefeller was as well placed as any to turn such information to advantage. Through such paths wealth and influence led to further wealth and influence.</p><p> From all the instances in which Rockefeller was offered chances to invest, of course, the trick was to choose the right ones. Certainly there was no shortage of opportunities to take part in everything from the young Spalding athletic goods company to "the greatest Real-estate scheme ever undertaken on this continent" to "the copper monopoly of the century," to be headed by former Civil War general George B. McClellan.**** In this subseries, the reader can see virtually the whole sweep of investment vehicles, options, schemes, risks, and rewards churned up by the booming American economy of the Gilded Age.</p><p>  Glenn Porter Director Hagley Museum and Library ---------------------------------------------------- * Stafford to Rockefeller, May 14, 1891.

Rockefeller's achievement and importance, but the office correspondence issued is even more extensive and more fascinating than the business material. By the latter part of the 1870s Rockefeller was a widely known figure, and the number and variety of persons who wrote to him is remarkable. They wrote for almost every imaginable reason. Mostly they cajoled, begged, and curried favor. Here we hear America singing, though hardly the songs Walt Whitman heard. Alpha the Astrologer, for example, wrote from New York City: "Successfully answers all questions pertaining to buying and selling of stocks, bonds, grain, cotton, real estate, journeys &amp; etc. Two dollars . . . Highest references if required."* Requests for loans were common, often bearing some assurance like that in a letter from Benjamin Albertson, contractor and builder of Asbury Park, New Jersey: "I am not a speculator or crank of any kind." Albertson, like many of the correspondents, did not actually know Rockefeller but felt no compunction about making the most outrageous demands of him. "I will call at your Residence No 4 W 54th st on Thursday Evening the 18th inst at 8:30 P.M.," Albertson peremptorily announced, "to see if you will save me from ruin. It will not take a large amount of money, and I have Real Estate security that I can give you."**</p><p> Sometimes those in public life felt that Mr. Rockefeller was in their debt, and they were not shy about asking for what they felt was coming to them. Paul Babcock, Jr., one of Rockefeller's business associates, wrote in 1880, for example, to find out how the Standard Oil Company wished to respond to a request from an influential Democrat in the New Jersey state legislature: "I have received a message from the Hon. Thos. H. O'Connor of Newark that he would be glad to receive his expenses incurred in the recent session . . . in introducing &amp; urging his Bill against Pipe Lines in the State of New Jersey . . . My own judgment was &amp; is to refuse to pay one dollar!"***</p><p> Appeals came from the mighty as well as from the less well known. The rich were already practicing the habit of soliciting each other in support of their personal good causes. Many of those in society and in the business world contacted Mr. Rockefeller seeking donations. Andrew Carnegie, for example, wrote in 1889 seeking a gift for what would shortly emerge as Carnegie Hall: "Perhaps the effort to give New York what the Post recently said was its most pressing need may commend itself to you," the steel king opened. "Our numerous musical organizations would naturally be gratified to have your name among their supporters." And, lest the oil magnate think this some otherworldly scheme, Carnegie assured him that "the Hall will be managed . . . upon business principles to pay interest like any other Real Estate investment."****</p><p> Requests for testimonials and endorsements of products were among the many demands made of Mr. Rockefeller. Fred Adee &amp; Co., purveyors of plumbers' supplies and sole agents for Zane's patent water closet ("The Sanitary"), asked whether he would oblige with an opinion of the merits of their product, recently installed in his residence. "We are about to issue a new catalogue and desire to include in it a testimonial from you," they explained.***** Many people also wrote seeking jobs or help for their sick and dying relatives.</p><p> Few good causes went forward without offering him the opportunity to take part. Solicitations from museums, hospitals, temperance groups, welfare organizations of every stripe and hue, and educational institutions were particularly evident. Most received standard polite but negative replies from his staff, though a great many succeeded in winning his help. Among these were some of the nation's major universities, particularly Brown and the new University of Chicago, to which Rockefeller gave millions. He exercised his influence on behalf of his favored institutions in manifold ways, as a letter from his trusted lieutenant Frederick T. Gates shows. From the Standard headquarters at 26 Broadway, Gates wrote in 1893 to Rockefeller in Cleveland:</p><p>  President E. Benjamin Andrews of Brown University called upon me yesterday explaining that his call was simply friendly without business. I knew, however, he must have some object. In the course of the conversation seeing that he was not going to unfold his errand but expected me to open up, I waited until he was ready to go, and in fact had started. I then called him back and ventured to hope that he had not given up the idea of going to Chicago with Dr. [William Rainey] Harper. He then opened up the real business for which he came. He said he was not sure whether Mr. Rockefeller personally would like to have him go or not. I told him . . . that Mr. Rockefeller would be distinctly gratified if he could find it in the line of his duty to go to Chicago and take hold with Dr. Harper. He seemed to have a burden lifted by the announcement. I have written very briefly to Dr. Harper and I think it now very probable that Andrews can be had.******</p><p> By far the greatest volume of letters related to requests from those pursuing religious or moral goals, above all for Baptist causes. J. B. Cranfill, Superintendent of Missions for the Baptist General Convention of Texas, wrote repeatedly, though apparently unsuccessfully. Texas, he noted, "is a vast foreign and home mission field and the work for the Master here has paid. Our people use your 'Standard Oil' for they can't get any other kind, and I feel that you ought to give me some mission money to keep these people from getting into the oil tank of the future world. I will be satisfied with $500 and will not boycott your oil if you don't give a cent. With cordial good wishes and trusting the Lord will help you in all things, I am, Yours Fraternally, J. B. Cranfill."*******</p><p> The pleas for contributions often received the same thorough, rational, careful evaluation that Rockefeller's staff gave to his investments. Frederick T. Gates handled much of this work, and it is interesting to compare his reports on proposed for-profit investments with his quite similar judgments about the soundness, stability, and long-run prospects of charitable supplicants. For example, Gates, in his capacity as the corresponding secretary of the American Baptist Education Society, investigated and then reported adversely on the request for a sanitarium for Baptist missionaries. He listed numerous reasons, such as the fact that "the $1,200 endows a bed not a room, which would take $15,000 it appears including treatment." In addition, "the fund goes to the sanitarium co. not as your correspondent supposes to the Missionary Union," and furthermore, "the sanitarium affords insufficient guaranties of permanency."******** Similarly, in responding to an inquiry from Rockefeller's secretary, George D. Rogers, Gates urged that a loan not be given to a milling company whose owner did business with a barge firm in which Rockefeller had an interest, ticking off a long list of reasons ranging from the fact that the collateral was not valuable to considerations that the business was "a very fluctuating one," "profits are uncertain," and "why should he [Rockefeller] be saddled with every enterprise which can possibly contribute to the Barge profits."********* All inquiries, whether seeking contributions, loans, or favors, took on added complexity when they came from someone with a business connection to Rockefeller. Gates, for example, proceeded cautiously in a matter involving a request for a Baptist charity when "the fact this gentleman is probably connected with your business . . . leads me to await your instructions before undertaking a thorough investigation."********** The same subtlety and care were called for on the part of others associated with Rockefeller. The secretary of the University of Chicago, for example, made an exception to his usual policy of refusing to "address you on business" by commending to Rockefeller a gentleman seeking investors in "the new process of making aluminum." The reason was that the person in question, "a man of very rare intelligence &amp; beautiful spirit," had made a $20,000 contribution to the seminary endowment at the university and "I cannot therefore say no! to him."*********** The tangled web of connections shaped not only the personal and philanthropic correspondence, but also the materials relating to business investments, found in Subseries I.</p><p>  Glenn Porter Director Hagley Museum and Library --------------------------------------------------------- * Alpha the Astrologer to John D.

His numerous ledgers and account books and the voluminous correspondence generated on his behalf amply illustrate his practice of careful record-keeping.</p><p> Rockefeller also kept careful track of the money that he gave away to friends, relatives, strangers, churches, and other charitable purposes. One aspect of his record-keeping with respect to his charity was his system of noting his gifts on index cards. Rockefeller apparently began to keep this index of his charitable gifts sometime in the early or mid 1880s, but he went back through his ledgers to add select earlier gifts from as far back as 1863. At the top of each card, Rockefeller listed the name of the individual or organization for which the gift was intended; below it he recorded the date and the amount of each gift, along with the name of the individual to whom it was sent. Occasionally his list of gifts to a particular beneficiary would fill the card and he would begin a second card; gifts to several of Rockefeller's beneficiaries required more than two cards. </p><p> These cards generally span the period from about 1863 through 1903. The entries for the 1860s and 1870s seem incomplete and less precise than those beginning in the 1880s. This suggests that these entries were added at a later date from a review of the "Donations" pages in Rockefeller's ledgers. Rockefeller's gifts after 1903 were recorded on another set of index cards, but these have not been included in this subseries.</p><p> Rockefeller contributed money to both institutions and to individuals, and he aided a wide variety of causes. He provided support to about 220 churches and missionary organizations of his own denomination, as well as to about 80 institutions of other denominations; to more than 160 social welfare and moral reform organizations and institutions; and to more than 100 schools and universities. His financial gifts also aided emergency relief efforts in the wake of disasters; the work of cultural institutions and artistic organizations; efforts to conserve the environment; the work of museums, libraries, lyceums, science societies, exploratory scientific expeditions, and other efforts toward the promotion of knowledge; civic causes and the promotion of particular public policies and political candidates. Rockefeller also contributed to hospitals and dispensaries for medical and health care; to police and fire units to promote public safety, as well as to military organizations and veterans groups; campaigns to fund statues, portraits, memorial funds, and other tributes to noteworthy people; to fairs and entertainments; as well as other miscellaneous causes.</p><p> Rockefeller also made gifts to individuals for various purposes. Often these gifts were for the education of the recipient or that of someone else. At other times these gifts were for musical purposes; in support of particular churches or religious institutions; and for social welfare and moral reform-related purposes. He also made personal gifts to more than 120 individual ministers and missionaries.</p><p> This listing will be especially useful to researchers seeking information about particular late-19th and early-20th century organizations and institutions. Many people wrote to Rockefeller requesting gifts for specific purposes, but since incoming letters to Rockefeller are arranged alphabetically by correspondent, researchers sometimes have found it difficult to locate correspondence about particular institutions without knowing the names of all likely solicitors. By bringing together organizations and the correspondents who successfully solicited gifts from Rockefeller on their behalf, this list will facilitate access to Rockefeller's correspondence, especially when used in conjunction with the "Index to the John D. Rockefeller Letterbooks 1877-1918" (1987), a copy of which is available at the Rockefeller Archive Center.</p></scopecontent><odd id="aspace_a305b5ead71cd30c3fb92c8080337b30"><head>General note</head><p>Much of the information contained in Rockefeller's charities index system has been reproduced in the folder entries found in the database. There is an entry for the name of each institution and person for whom there is a card. Also included are the total amount of financial gifts noted on the card(s) for the institution or individual: these are taken from the mathematical calculations noted on the cards. Any other notation at the top of the card is also indicated, including cross references noted by Rockefeller or his staff. To facilitate the use of this list, we have added additional cross references where appropriate. The date or a range of dates that represent the first and last year for which there are entries on the card are noted as well.</p><p> In the Description field, the names of any people listed in the entries for specific gifts are noted in alphabetical order; these are the people to whom Rockefeller sent or gave the money, and in many cases they are officers of the beneficiary organizations, volunteer fund raisers who contacted Rockefeller about a donation, or the relatives and friends of a needy individual. For many cards for individual gift recipients, no name appears next to the date and amount of the gift; presumably these gifts went directly to the beneficiary.</p><p> We have tried to be as accurate as possible in compiling this list, but often the small and imprecise handwriting on the cards made the names difficult to read. For doubtful entries other resources in the collections were used for clues to the precise name, but there many be a few inaccurate renderings of individual or place names. The entries in this database do not include either the dates or amounts of specific gifts. For this information, readers should consult the original cards.</p></odd><c id="e362b461485240b1b28002fb6e016e9c" level="file"><did><unittitle>A F C U - $45.00</unittitle><unitdate normal="1864/1868" type="inclusive">1864-1868</unitdate><container id="616324aa344923c40032e3cf5a1ef2d4" label="Mixed Materials [929975.1.318]" type="box">1</container><container id="a489cb42f601839d7702d00ee5dea2a4" parent="616324aa344923c40032e3cf5a1ef2d4" type="folder">1</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_2a43e347d7c03f11f942ed0547e9484a"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>Erie Street Baptist Church</p></scopecontent></c><c id="0228f4cc50074c0a82efc67a425cdb16" level="file"><did><unittitle>Miss Abbots' friend - $50.00</unittitle><unitdate normal="1887/1887" type="inclusive">1887</unitdate><container id="45d6175533e133c0ef22513c40f16421" label="Mixed Materials [929975.1.318]" type="box">1</container><container id="07ff534f3e421ffdccb01be4db27fd9c" parent="45d6175533e133c0ef22513c40f16421" type="folder">2</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_f979187dd9ce9770abbdf68c37bd7fa1"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>Rockefeller, Bessie</p></scopecontent></c><c id="8b7e99d114364548820d49a518448135" level="file"><did><unittitle>Abry, Mrs. H.
