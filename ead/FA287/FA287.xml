    <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
<p>The Commonwealth Fund was established in 1918 with an endowment of $10 million from Mrs. Stephen V. Harkness for "benevolent, religious, educational and like purposes." The early grants supported a variety of programs while generally promoting welfare, especially child welfare. Several grants were made in the field of medical research, but the Board of Directors decided in 1920 that this field was already sufficiently supported by other philanthropic organizations.</p><p>Despite this decision, by the mid-1920s the chief interest of the Fund had become public health, including mental hygiene, community health, rural hospitals, medical research, and medical education. Other grant areas included war relief, educational and legal research, child welfare, and international medical fellowships.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
<p>Only two files from the Commonwealth Fund's Educational Research Program remain. The rest were destroyed on February 25, 1949, under Barry C. Smith's instructions. The first file, The Survey of Rural Education in New York State, was appeal #287 and received the Commonwealth code designation 1225-S. This survey, begun in 1920, represents one of the earliest projects funded by the CF. A "Committee of Twenty One" comprised of noted New York educators oversaw the survey project. Members from the Dairyman's League, The New York State Department of Education, the Farm Bureau Federation, the State Grange, the State College of Agriculture, the New York State Teachers Association, and the New York State Federation of Home Bureaus actively participated in the survey. Samuel C. Fairley, assistant director of the Commonwealth Fund, George M. Wiley of the University of the State of New York, and John H. Finley, New York State Commissioner of Education, directed the survey.</p><p>The Social Science Research Council, appeal #1754 and code 1225-B, was organized on May 17, 1923, on the recommendation of the Committee on Political Research, a division of the American Political Science association. The purpose of the Research Council was threefold: 1) abstract and index current material in the social sciences, 2) survey the organization and work of research agencies active in the social sciences, and 3) lobby the United States Congress to initiate the publication of an annual digest or index to state legislature. Representatives from the American Economic Association, the American Statistical Association, the American Psychological Association, the American Anthropological Association, the American Historical Association, the American Sociological Society, and the American Political Science Association sat on the Council.</p><p>The existing files for both grants contain correspondence relating to general and financial matters, memoranda, and also progress reports. A miscellaneous file concerning the entire Educational Research Program is also included in this series.</p>  </scopecontent>
