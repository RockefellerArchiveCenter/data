    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>Collection contains the office files that Vanita Nayak Mukherjee created when she served as a Program Officer for the Ford Foundation's New Delhi, India Regional Office. The New Delhi Regional Office oversees programming for the countries of India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. Mukherjee's office files collection consists of one series of program strategy related records that concern the New Delhi Office's program strategy for sexuality and reproductive health in India as well as program strategy at the Ford Foundation in a broader sense. </p><p>Common materials found in the collection include correspondence, drafts, notes, reports, agendas, meeting minutes, other meeting materials, tables, procedure guidelines, and publications. In addition to the materials Mukherjee created during her tenure at the Ford Foundation from 2006 to 2018, there are also earlier records that she may have either received, inherited, or gathered. These materials appear to have been used to help inform Mukherjee's work with formulating program strategy, to get her acquainted with Foundation practices and procedures for grant making, and for the commemoration of the New Delhi Office's 50th anniversary in 2002.</p>  </scopecontent>
