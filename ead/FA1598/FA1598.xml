<p>The Commonwealth Fund records are arranged in three subgroups, each comprised of multiple series and/or accessions. The subgroups and associated series numbers are representative solely of when the materials were processed by RAC, and do not imply an original order of the records. Additional finding aids are created as records are processed and open for research.</p><p>Series are primarily designated by record type or division/program.</p>  </arrangement>
  <scopecontent id="3a2b159930d3c7867f5a4d42d9d8ed8f">
    <head>Scope and Contents</head>

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The Commonwealth Fund was established in 1918 with an endowment of $10 million from Mrs. Stephen V. Harkness for "benevolent, religious, educational and like purposes." The early grants supported a variety of programs while generally promoting welfare, especially child welfare. Several grants were made in the field of medical research, but the Board of Directors decided in 1920 that this field was already sufficiently supported by other philanthropic organizations. </p>


<p>Despite this decision, by the mid-1920s the chief interest of the Fund had become public health, including mental hygiene, community health, rural hospitals, medical research, and medical education. Other grant areas included war relief, educational and legal research, child welfare, and international medical fellowships.</p>
