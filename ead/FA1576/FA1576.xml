    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>After World War II the Rockefeller family office grew rapidly as John D. Rockefeller Jr.'s sons began actively working in the office. One new department established in 1946 was that of Public Relations. </p>

<p>Under the direction of Francis A. Jamieson the Public Relations department initially spent most of its efforts on Nelson A. Rockefeller's Latin American activities. The department also prepared press releases and offered public relations advise to the other brothers and occasionally for JDR Jr. </p>

<p>In many ways the department also became the eyes and ears of the office. Two newspaper clipping services were engaged as well as a radio monitoring service. The clippings and reports were circulated among the five brothers and clipping scrapbooks -- which appear in the collection as series 2 and 3 -- were made. </p>

<p>As the activities of the brothers grew during the 1950s and 1960s the Public Relations department was given increasing responsibilities in the preparation of family and office policy toward a great variety of social, economic and cultural activities. To provide sufficient background on this expanding universe the department established research files which were maintained by staff. </p>

<p>The department also collected periodical literature containing articles about or of interest to the Rockefellers. This literature was not systematically collected or compiled. The PR department also inherited a backlog of magazine articles from the files of various administrative assistants. One important source of back periodicals that are now included in this collection are the files kept by Robert W. Gumbel, once private secretary to JDR Jr. and later office manager. </p>
