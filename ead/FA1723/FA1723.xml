<p>The Ford Foundation was chartered by Henry and Edsel Ford in 1936 "to receive and administer funds for scientific, educational and charitable purposes, all for the public welfare", and initially served the Ford family's charitable interests in the Detroit area. Following the deaths of Edsel Ford (1943) and Henry Ford (1947), the Foundation was propelled to the forefront of philanthropy as the largest American foundation in terms of both endowment and yearly expenditures, and with an international scope to its major program areas. During the Foundation's first twenty years its major programs were in international economic development, primary and higher education, educational and public broadcasting, behavioral sciences, civil liberties, urban development, fine arts and the humanities. The Ford Foundation also partnered with the Rockefeller Foundation in supporting agricultural development in South America, Africa, and Southeast Asia. Since the 1970s, the Foundation has also pioneered programs in women's rights, energy policy, micro-financing in under-developed countries, establishing human rights groups, and improving international HIV/AIDS education.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>Collection consists of photographs and associated materials that document the art collection the Ford Foundation acquired between 1966 and 1967 through the Art Purchase Program. The collection is comprised of one series of artwork photograph files. These files generally contain photographs, photograph negatives, and invoices that regard a piece of art (or a set of art) that the Foundation purchased for the New York City headquarters building it opened in 1967. The files provide photographic evidence of the artwork, information about the artist who created it, information about the material details and dimensions of the artwork, and information about the purchase of the item. They are organized by the name of the artist.</p><p>
Archival documentation left in the containers originally housing the records indicate that the Ford Foundation's Building Services department maintained the files. Building Services was a part of the Logistical Services unit in the Foundation's Division of Administration.</p><p>
Invoices and a small amount of correspondence in the files show how Yale University Art Gallery Director Andrew Carnduff Ritchie purchased the art on behalf of the Ford Foundation. The Foundation purchased art from various galleries and art dealers in San Francisco, New York, London, Paris, Zurich, Lucerne, and Amsterdam. This art was created by artists of American, Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Russian, and Spanish origin, among others. Some of these artists include Marc Chagall, Salvador Dali, Eugene Delacroix, Henri Matisse, and Pablo Picasso.</p><p>
A few art books and gallery exhibition descriptions can be found in the collection. There is also a record created long after the art collection that the photograph files describe was acquired by the Ford Foundation. This letter from 2019 inquired about a piece of art that had once been part of the collection but was now in the possession of the correspondent.  </p>  </scopecontent>
