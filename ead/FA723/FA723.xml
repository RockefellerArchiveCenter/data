    <abstract id="aspace_6664beb748d1b873413ac79c5bcbc073">The Office Files of George Gant were transferred to the Archives in 1978 with other material from the International Division/Asia and Pacific. The papers were originally described as "conference files." The correspondence, agendas, working papers and reports were actually generated in connection with various seminars, meetings and study groups that Mr. Gant either attended or helped to organize. These files may not represent all the seminars/meetings that Mr. Gant participated in between 1962 and 1967 but only those retained in his office files. 

Researchers should be aware that there is additional Gant material in the Archives. There is approximately 50' of field office records from Bangkok, Thailand. These field office records include files that were created and maintained by Mr. Gant but continued by his successors and interfiled with their papers. This material was sent to the Archives when the Bangkok office closed in 1981.</abstract>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Office Files of George Gant consist of a single series, Seminar/ Meeting Files. These files were generated as a result of Mr. Gant's participation as a member or organizer of various seminars, study groups, meetings and advisory groups. The seminars and meetings date from 1962 to 1967 and were sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations, the Southeast Development Advisory Group, the United Nations and jointly, the Ford Foundation and the Comparative Administration Group (a branch of the American Society for Public Administration). The papers and reports, and measure onehalf foot.</p><p>The files have two research strengths. First is the documentation of the planning process for development and public administration in developing countries: how the questions of who would be trained and how and where they would be trained were considered. The topic of  development administration is addressed in the Ford Foundation/Comparative Administration Group, Southeast Asia/ Development Advisory Group and United Nations folders. A second research strength is found in the Council on Foreign Affairs Study Group folders. These folders contain information on variety of topics (see container listing) but all have a common theme: the emerging roles of India and Pakistan in the strategic and political balance of Asia and the world. </p><p>The files do not document Mr. Gant's 22-year career with the Ford Foundation. However, they do indicate his interests and professional commitment to South Asia and development administration.</p>  </scopecontent>
