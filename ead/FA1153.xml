    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The Ford Foundation was chartered by Henry and Edsel Ford in 1936 "to receive and administer funds for scientific, educational and charitable purposes, all for the public welfare", and initially served the Ford family's charitable interests in the Detroit area. Following the deaths of Edsel Ford (1943) and Henry Ford (1947), the Foundation was propelled to the forefront of philanthropy as the largest American foundation in terms of both endowment and yearly expenditures, and with an international scope to its major program areas. During the Foundation's first twenty years its major programs were in international economic development, primary and higher education, educational and public broadcasting, behavioral sciences, civil liberties, urban development, fine arts and the humanities. The Ford Foundation also partnered with the Rockefeller Foundation in supporting agricultural development in South America, Africa, and Southeast Asia. Since the 1970s, the Foundation has also pioneered programs in women's rights, energy policy, micro-financing in under-developed countries, establishing human rights groups, and improving international HIV/AIDS education.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>Collection contains records that the Ford Foundation Office of Reports created to plan and document various photograph exhibit projects. Exhibits were produced to promote the work of the Ford Foundation in broad program areas such as support for American theater and women in developing countries as well as the work of individual initiatives and artists. </p><p>
Photographs, photograph negatives, slides, exhibit panel proofs, and arrangement maps document how the Office of Reports planned the images, text, and configuration of exhibits. In addition to containing images that were selected and under consideration for use in exhibits, the collection also includes photographs that were taken of exhibits. Correspondence, memos, drafts, notes, purchase orders, invoices, and expense reports document the planning, production, and financing of exhibits. Much of the correspondence was created by Graphics Manager Nancy Boggs and her fellow Office of Reports staff member Ruth Neumann. The records they produced show how the Office of Reports reached out to Ford Foundation staff and external organizations for photographs to use in exhibits, contracted consultants for photography, exhibit design, exhibit production, and exhibit installation, and arranged and promoted exhibit events.</p><p>
Other materials in the collection such as brochures, newspaper clippings, newsletters, and publications generally provide background information on the subjects of the different exhibits. The exhibit producers may have used these resources as reference materials when planning the exhibits.</p>  </scopecontent>

Records suggest that Graphics Manager Nancy Boggs and her fellow Office of Reports staff member Ruth Neumann were responsible for much of the planning and execution of these projects. Their correspondence shows how they reached out to Ford Foundation staff and external organizations for photographs to use in exhibits, how they contracted consultants for photography, exhibit design, exhibit production, and exhibit installation, and how they arranged and promoted exhibit events. Exhibits were produced to promote the work of the Ford Foundation in broad program areas such as support for American theater and women in developing countries as well as the work of individual initiatives and artists.</p><p>
The series contains photographs, photograph negatives, and slides that were selected and under consideration for use in the different exhibits. There are also drafts of exhibit panel proofs that document what text the exhibit producers wanted to include as well as arrangement plans and maps that document how the exhibit producers wanted to configure the display materials. Purchase orders, invoices, and expense reports provide additional information on the planning and production of exhibits. Other materials such as brochures, newspaper clippings, newsletters, and publications generally provide background information on the subjects of the different exhibits. The exhibit producers may have used these resources as reference materials when planning the exhibits. A file in the series that regards the Mississippi Action for Community Education (MACE) and Delta Foundation also includes audio recordings of interviews with different people involved with the organizations. </p><p>
Lastly, there are still images within the series that provide evidence of the actual exhibits. They are photographs of the finished exhibit panels and display spaces.</p></scopecontent><c id="32d9223fa1b49fb5789b7f97e7d94587" level="file"><did><unittitle>Mexico City exhibit - Modern Educational Aids</unittitle><unitdate certainty="inferred" normal="1961/1961">circa 1961</unitdate><container altrender="Legal Document Box" id="9bd9ae76990b36a47c872bd52bfa6203" label="Still Image [A0000000115674]" type="box">1</container><container id="748be50276514b323f2abf2ccc70d730" parent="9bd9ae76990b36a47c872bd52bfa6203" type="folder">1</container></did><scopecontent id="71180c19cc0faad6b30b39adab480be2"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Still images are photographs of panels at Modern Educational Aids exhibit.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="98ac0aa7cf07bd52fbea02b77886bcce" level="file"><did><unittitle>Population exhibit</unittitle><unitdate normal="1970/1970">1970</unitdate><physdesc id="1d98f94327b1e6de063aa862a83f7be0">File contains still images.
