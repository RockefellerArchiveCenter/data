      <p>This finding aid is an artificial compilation of photographic materials at RAC. </p>
      <p>It is not a comprehensive representation of all photographic holdings available at the Rockefeller Archive Center. </p>
      <p>Processing and description practices at RAC prior to 2008 assigned a four-digit series number to each collection of photographs. The term photographs was used broadly to encompass graphic materials and may also include a small selection of audio or video materials. This finding aid describes those photographic collections, arranged by Series Number.</p>
      <p>While seperation of graphic materials from the body of their original collections remains a critical aspect of the care provided by RAC to address the specific needs and ensure the long-term preservation of these holdings, the practice of assigning four-digit series numbers was discontinued in 2008. </p>

          <p>Lawrence Boardman Dunham was born in Newton, Massachusetts, on July 18, 1882, and received the Ph.B degree from Yale University in 1904.  He graduated from the New York Law School in 1907 and entered into practice in New York City until 1913, when he was appointed Deputy Commissioner of Bridges for New York City.  The following year, he was named Deputy Commissioner of the Police, a post he retained until 1922. On June 10, 1915, he married (Margaret) Vrayling Putnam; their family included three children.</p>
          <p>Dunham's tenure with the Police Department was interrupted by his service in the U.S. Army during World War I.  In 1918 he served with the rank of Major in the intelligence division and was stationed primarily at Hoboken, New Jersey.  Upon his resignation from the Police Department in 1922, he joined the G.M.P. Murphy Company, and until 1925 was president of the Caddo Central (later Clayton) Oil and Refining Company.</p>
          <p>From 1925 until 1928 Dunham was associated with the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial, directing studies of crime and juvenile delinquency.  For the next six years (1928-1934), he was Director of the Bureau of Social Hygiene, where he developed programs reflecting his interests while involved with the LSRM.   During 1931-1932 he also served as a technical advisor to the U.S. delegation to the League of Nations Opium Convention in Geneva, Switzerland.</p>
          <p>Dunham acted as campaign manager in the Bronx for Fiorello H. LaGuardia's first mayoral contest in 1933.  During the first 16 months of LaGuardia's term, he served as Executive Secretary to the Mayor.  On April 16, 1935, he was appointed City Magistrate, and on September 23 of the same year was named to the Domestic Relations Court of New York City.</p>
          <p>In 1942, Judge Dunham reentered active service with the U.S. Army and was engaged in intelligence work with the General Staff Corps, serving with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.  He directed counterespionage and anti-sabotage operations on both the east and west coast of the United States.  In 1945 he was awarded the U.S. Legion of Merit.  After the war, he retired from the bench, and died on August 8, 1959, at Plattsburgh, New York.</p>

          <p>Edwin Embree (1883-1950) was born in Osceola, Nebraska, and lived as a youth in Colorado, Wyoming and Kentucky.  He graduated from Yale University in 1906 with a B.A. and then joined the staff of the New York Sun as a cub reporter assigned to police stations and theaters.  In 1907 he accepted a position as assistant editor of the Yale Alumni Weekly and remained at Yale in a variety of administrative capacities until 1917.  While at New Haven he continued his studies in philosophy and education and received an M.A. in 1913.</p>
          <p>In 1917 Mr. Embree joined The Rockefeller Foundation as Secretary under George E. Vincent. Interested in interracial relations, race development, human biology, and cultural anthropology, Embree became Director of the newly created Division of Studies in 1925, and developed some of these interests. He remained in that position until 1927 when he filled the position of Vice President of the Foundation.</p>
          <p>Pursuing his interests in interracial relations in 1927, Embree became Director of the Rosenwald Fund, a group which made appropriations to agencies working in the area of Negro welfare. After the depression the Fund concentrated on research and planning in connection with farm tenant problems. Several articles were written as a result of these studies which led to Federal legislation and the establishment of the Farm Security Administration. Having expended its resources, the Rosenwald Fund terminated in 1948. Embree then became President of the Liberian Foundation, a joint American-Liberian organization which assisted in the advancement of health, welfare and education in that country.</p>
          <p>Mr. Embree was the author of "Brown America, the story of a New Race," 1931; "Prospecting for Heaven," 1932; "American Negroes: A Handbook," 1932; "Indians of the Americas," 1939; "Brown Americans: the Story of a Tenth of the Nation," 1943; "Thirteen Against the Odds," 1944; and co-author of "Human Biology and Race Welfare," 1930.</p>

          <p>The Spelman Fund of New York was chartered as a corporation on December 27, 1928, exclusively for "charitable, scientific and educational purposes including the advancement and diffusion of knowledge concerning child life, the improvement of interracial relations and cooperation with public agencies."</p>
          <p>$10,000,000 was provided for The Spelman Fund by the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial shortly after the latter organization merged with The Rockefeller Foundation in 1929. The Memorial had developed a broad program in child study and interracial relations. Though the Fund continued to support some of the agencies previously supported by the Memorial for the duration of the particular grant, the main program of the Fund was in the area of public administration and intergovernmental relations. This was an area the Memorial had just begun to develop in its program, and it soon became the primary interest of the Fund. The Fund worked to improve the technical aspects of public administration. They supported activities which would improve exchange of technical information and experience and also activities of research to discover improved methods and techniques of organization.</p>
          <p>Many major appropriations were made to the "1313" agencies, i.e., the American Association of Public Welfare Officials, the American Legislators Association, the American Municipal Association, the American Public Welfare Association, the American Public Works Association, the American Society of Planning Officials, the Civil Service Assembly, the Council of State Governments, the Federation of Tax Administrators, the International City Managers Association, the Municipal Financial Officers Association, the National Association of Housing Officials, the Public Administration Clearing House and the Public Administration Service. These groups were brought together in Chicago in 1932, and later in a building on the campus of the University of Chicago. The address was 1313 E. 60th Street, hence the name.</p>
          <p>The final grant of unexpended funds was made to the Public Administration Clearing House, the nerve center of the "1313" agencies, and in 1949 the Fund was dissolved.</p>

          <p>The Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial was incorporated in October 1918, for general philanthropic purposes. It was not geographically limited and indeed was international, especially in its early emphasis on emergency relief. A memorial to Laura Spelman Rockefeller, the first thought for a program was the welfare of women and children, but philanthropy is not easily granted along divisions of age or sex and so for the first few years of the Memorial's existence the program was fluid. W. S. Richardson was the main executive during the years 1918-1922. The Memorial worked through John D. Rockefeller, Jr.'s office then, and many of the Memorial files were interwoven with other office files.</p>
          <p>In 1922 Beardsley Ruml became director of the Memorial and a long-range program was developed. Appropriations were still made in the areas of leisure, public health, and emergency relief, but from 1922 through the end of the Memorial's independent existence, the social sciences and welfare, child study and parent education, and interracial relations became primary interests. Research was sponsored, but not as an end unto itself; grants were made for demonstrations, concrete applications of newly gained knowledge. The aim of the entire program was to achieve concrete improvement in the conditions of life and to contribute realistically to public welfare.</p>
          <p>On January 3, 1929, the Memorial consolidated with The Rockefeller Foundation and became its division of Social Sciences. A final grant of $10,000,000 was made to the Spelman Fund of New York, an independently incorporated board, to administer some appropriations in child study, parent education, and interracial relations. The Spelman Fund went on to continue the Memorial's fledgling interest in public administration as its main emphasis.</p>

          <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
          <p>The Bureau of Social Hygiene resulted from the appointment of John D. Rockefeller, Jr., to a Special Grand Jury to investigate white slavery in New York City in 1910. In conferences taken in the course of this investigation, Mr. Rockefeller, Jr., became convinced that for a lasting improvement of conditions a permanent organization was needed. On March 22, 1911, The Committee of Three, including Mr. Rockefeller, Jr., Paul Warburg, and Starr Murphy, met. The name "Bureau of Social Hygiene" was first used in October of that year, but not consistently until 1913.</p>
          <p>In 1913 the Bureau was incorporated and its purpose was stated as "...the study, amelioration, and prevention of those social conditions, crimes, and diseases which adversely affect the well being of society, with special reference to prostitution and the evils associated therewith." The Bureau would engage in research and education, publish reports, and employ and/or cooperate with other public or private agencies to obtain these goals. The emphasis in the years from 1911 until the reorganization of 1928 was mainly on prostitution, the control of vice, and, through that, the relationships to police organization. Narcotics was also an early interest. Throughout these early years, Katherine Bement Davis, Commissioner of Charities and Correction of New York and later Superintendent of Bedford Hills Reformatory, guided the Bureau as General Secretary.</p>
          <p>Miss Davis resigned in 1928 and Lawrence B. Dunham was appointed Director. Under Mr. Dunham's administration, from 1928-1934, the Bureau developed a broadened interest in criminology. In 1929 the certificate of incorporation was amended and the emphasis on prostitution was dropped. Criminology embraced crime reporting, police training and education, penology, criminal law, and juvenile delinquency. While studies and projects were still conducted in narcotics and social hygiene, the main thrust of the organization was crime and criminology.</p>
          <p>The Bureau functioned through grants. It was not a foundation and had no set endowment. In the very early years of its existence, financial backing came from several sources including Paul Warburg, the New York Foundation, and John D. Rockefeller, Jr., although throughout the history of the Bureau, Mr. Rockefeller, Jr., was always the main contributor. Grants were occasionally channeled through the Bureau from the Spelman Fund of New York and the Rockefeller Foundation.</p>
          <p>Grants were made by the Bureau for a variety of types of work. Research studies were conducted, such as the Institute of Criminology and the Crew Study; books were published, such as "European Police Systems" and "Policewoman's Handbook"; fellowships were given, as were the fellowships in prison study; and experiments were conducted at the Massachusetts State Prison Colony and the Laboratory of Social Hygiene at Bedford Hills. Grants were most often long range covering periods of from three to five years. Although the Bureau did not interfere in the conduct of a project once money had been granted, it was careful in its selection of projects and kept in close touch during the life of the project.</p>
          <p>The Bureau ceased making new appropriations in 1934 and by mid-1937 all the previous commitments had been brought to a close. Annual meetings were held until 1940 when the Bureau was dissolved on November 13th.</p>

          <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
          <p>Jacob George Harrar was born in Painesville, Ohio, on December 2, 1906, to Ellwood Harrar, an engineer, and Lucetta Sternes Harrar. He attended Oberlin College from 1924 to 1928 where he majored in biology and excelled in athletics. After receiving the A.B. degree from Oberlin, Harrar continued his education at the Iowa State College of Agriculture and Mechanical Arts. He was awarded the M.S. degree in 1929 and immediately embarked on a career in teaching and agricultural research as an assistant professor at the College of Agriculture, University of Puerto Rico. Within a year Harrar became head of the department of biology. He left that position in 1934 to pursue a Ph.D. in plant pathology at the University of Minnesota. It was here he began a close personal and professional relationship with E. C. Stakman, under whom he studied. Later, in 1958, they collaborated on the book, "Principles of Plant Pathology."</p>
          <p>In 1935, Harrar, having achieved a doctorate degree in plant pathology, once again resumed teaching, accepting an assistant professorship at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute. Rising to full professor in 1937, Harrar remained at the Institute until 1941. From 1941 to 1942 he headed the Division of Plant Pathology and the Agricultural Experiment Station at Washington State College.</p>
          <p>In 1942, Harrar left academics to create and administer in Mexico the Rockefeller Foundation's first cooperative assistance program in agricultural science. With his team of American specialists, Harrar implemented a Foundation program of soil and hybrid experimentation to improve wheat and corn yields. Within a few years the Mexican program proved enormously successful and the Foundation was invited to implement the same program in Colombia, Chile, and India. Harrar is generally regarded as the father of what soon became known as "The Green Revolution."</p>
          <p>Harrar, in 1952, became Deputy Director for Agriculture, Division of Natural Sciences and Agriculture, of the Rockefeller Foundation. In 1955, he became Director for Agriculture organizing further projects in agricultural assistance and cooperation in all the Central American countries. He was appointed Vice President of the Foundation in 1959, and in 1961 succeeded Dean Rusk as its President. Under Harrar, the Rockefeller Foundation during the 1960s reoriented its programs to concentrate in five areas: the conquest of hunger, by improving the quantity and quality of food supplies; the solution of population problems; the strengthening of emerging centers of learning in developing nations; the provision of better educational opportunities for the disadvantaged groups in the U. S.; and the enhancement of the cultural lives of Americans.</p>
          <p>Retiring in 1972, Harrar was the first man ever to be appointed a Life Fellow of the Rockefeller Foundation. During the 1970s he continued his involvement as a member of such professional and scientific organizations as the National Academy of Sciences and the Nutrition Foundation. In 1980 he was awarded the Aztec Eagle Award, the highest honor bestowed by the Mexican government for service to their country by a foreign citizen. He also, during his lifetime, received numerous honors, degrees, and citations from many other foreign governments and from both American and foreign universities.</p>
          <p>In addition to "Strategy for the Conquest of Hunger, Selected Papers of J. George Harrar," he was the author of numerous scientific research papers in the fields of phytopathology and mycology, and many articles of general interest on world food problems, population, private philanthropy, economic development overseas, and environmental quality.</p>
          <p>J. George Harrar died on April 18, 1982.</p>

          <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
          <p>Hugh Hollingsworth Smith was born in Easley, South Carolina, on December 12, 1902.  He received an A.B. degree from Davidson College in 1923, an M.D. from Johns Hopkins University in 1927, and an M.P.H. from Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health in 1935.</p>
          <p>From 1920-1930 Dr. Smith was an Instructor in Medicine at the University of Rochester.  He became a special member of the International Health Division of The Rockefeller Foundation in 1930 and from 1931-1934, Dr. Smith conducted tuberculosis studies in Kingston, Jamaica.  He worked in the yellow fever labs in Brazil during 1937-1938 and in Colombia in 1938-1941.  In 1941 he was appointed a member of the Rockefeller Health Commission and was attached to the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.  During his time in London he was a member of the Tropical Advisory Committee on Medical Service and Supplies of the Allied Postwar Requirements Bureau, served as liaison for the British Colonial Office in connection with the development of public health programs in the British West Indies and Africa and was involved in nutritional studies for the war effort.</p>
          <p>In 1944 Dr. Smith returned to the United States as Assistant Director of the International Health Division and Regional Director for the United States.  In 1951 he became Associate Director of the Division of Medical and Public Health and served in that capacity until he retired in 1954.</p>
          <p>After his retirement from the Foundation, Dr. Smith moved to Arizona, where he was a professor of microbiology at the University of Arizona.  In 1959 he set up a lab at the University for the study of arthropod-borne virus, and in 1961 he was awarded a grant by the National Institute of Health which ran through 1966 for research in arthropod-borne encephalitis in Southern Arizona.</p>
          <p>Dr. Smith contributed articles to a variety of medical journals including Arizona Medicine and was a co-author of "Yellow Fever," ed. G. K. Strode, 1951.  In 1978 he published his memoirs, "Life's a Pleasant Institution: The Peregrinations of a Rockefeller Doctor."  He died in December 1995.</p>

          <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
          <p>A physician, public health officer, and author, Benjamin E. Washburn was born in Rutherford County, North Carolina, in 1885.  Dr. Washburn received undergraduate (1906) and graduate (1909) degrees in English and history from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and graduated from the University of Virginia in 1911 with a degree in medicine.  It was during his internship in Wilmington, North Carolina, that he met Zillah Howe, a nurse from Michigan, whom he married October 6, 1912.</p>
          <p>Following a brief private practice in Rutherford County, North Carolina, Dr. Washburn began his long connection with Rockefeller organizations as an employee of the Rockefeller Sanitary Commission. As field director for Haywood, Stanley, and Caswell counties in North Carolina, he led a hookworm eradication campaign; he later (May-December 1914) became a full-time health officer in Nash County, North Carolina, as part of a program of community sanitary work funded by The Rockefeller Foundation.</p>
          <p>In 1915 Dr. Washburn was appointed field director for the International Health Commission's campaign for control of hookworm in British Guiana and Trinidad. Returning to North Carolina in 1916, Washburn, as county health officer in Wilson County, developed a program of health work intended to serve as a model for other counties and as a training center for International Health Board field staff. In 1917, Dr. Washburn was appointed director of the new state Bureau of County Health Work where he was responsible for the creation of cooperative health programs in ten North Carolina counties.</p>
          <p>Dr. Washburn left North Carolina again in 1930 to direct the IHB's Hookworm Campaign in Jamaica and remained to inaugurate and oversee the Malaria Campaign, the Tuberculosis Commission, and the Bureau of Health Education. In 1935, he was appointed regional director for the International Health Division in the West Indies and Central America. Washburn retired from The Rockefeller Foundation in 1939.</p>
          <p>Upon retirement, Washburn returned to Rutherfordton, North Carolina, where he was active in state and local public health affairs. He also served as health editor for the Raleigh, North Carolina, "Progressive Farmer" from 1940 to 1951 and wrote several books devoted to his health interests.</p>
          <p>Dr. Washburn is the author of "Jamaica Health Stories and Plays" (1929); "The Health Game" (1930); "A Country Doctor in the South Mountains" (1955); "As I Recall" (1960); "Rutherford County and Its Hospital" (1960); and "A History of the North Carolina State Board of Health, 1877-1925" (1966).</p>

          <p>The International Education Board was incorporated January 12, 1923, in the state of Virginia. Its purpose was to promote education, institutional or otherwise, throughout the world and as such was a complement to the General Education Board which functioned in the United States. Wickliffe Rose resigned from the International Health Board in 1923 to become director of both boards. At his retirement in 1928, the International Education Board discontinued its active program.</p>
          <p>The International Education Board promoted the advancement of education through grants to universities and through a multitude of fellowships to individuals. It sponsored the strengthening of disciplines with such grants as those to develop Mount Palomar and traveling professorships and fellowships. While the main fields of the board were the physical and natural sciences and agriculture, some appropriations were made in the humanities and social sciences as to the American Academy in Rome, the Oriental Institute in Chicago and the New York State Colonization Society for the Booker Washington Agricultural and Industrial Institute of Liberia.</p>
          <p>The Board terminated its activities on December 31, 1938.</p>

          <p>Jackson Davis (1882-1947) was born in Cumberland County, Virginia, and attended the College of William and Mary.  He received a Master of Arts degree from Columbia University in 1908, and an LL.D. from the University of Richmond in 1930.  Beginning his career in education soon after graduating from William and Mary, his first position was that of school principal in Williamsburg.  After a year he moved to Roanoake where he was assistant secretary of the YMCA, a group he had joined in his undergraduate days.  In 1904 he was again a school principal, this time in Marion, Virginia.  The following year he accepted a position as superintendent of schools for Henrico County, Virginia.  In 1909 Mr. Davis became a member of the Board of Examiners and Inspectors for the Virginia State Board of Education.</p>
          <p>Negro and rural education were interests to which Jackson Davis devoted much of his life.  In 1909 he accepted a position as state agent for Negro rural schools in Virginia, which he held until he became a general field agent for the General Education Board in 1915.  He became assistant director in 1929 and associate director in 1933.  In addition, he was also a trustee of the Phelps-Stokes Fund.</p>
          <p>Interested in education on an international scale as well, Mr. Davis served as secretary of the International Education Board from 1923-1938.  He was a Carnegie visitor to Africa in 1935 and a member of the Committee on Interracial Cooperation, the Advisory Committee on Education in Liberia, and president of the board of trustees of the Booker Washington Institute, Liberia.</p>
          <p>Outside of his professional interests in education, Mr. Davis was a member of the Virginia Academy of Science and the Virginia Historical Society.  A contributor to many education journals, he was a joint author of "Africa Advancing," 1945.</p>

          <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
          <p>The American International Association for Economic and Social Development (AIA) (1946-1968), was established by Nelson A. Rockefeller in July 1946 as a privately financed non-profit philanthropic organization aimed to help promote "self-development and better standards of living, together with understanding and cooperation" in Latin America. The AIA worked closely with local governments and other established organizations to develop programs which could eventually be supported and managed locally. Primarily, the AIA's activities focused on rural rehabilitation and agricultural development, with concentrated efforts on cooperative programs with the governments of Brazil and Venezuela. The AIA was also active in agricultural research and nutritional education as well as improving local roads, communications, and primary education. </p>
          <p>The AIA Photograph collection primarily documents the AIA operations in Brazil and Venezuela, with some documentation on their work in Chile, Ecuador, Italy, Peru, Puerto Rico, and the United States. The collection is varied, ranging from photographs of administrative affairs and gatherings to home improvements in rural households to strictly panoramic photographs of the Latin American landscape.</p>

          <head>Arrangement note</head>
          <p>The AIA Photograph Collection has been separated into six distinct subseries, based on subject and media. The first four series include only photographs.</p>
          <p>Subseries 1, General; Subseries 2, Brazil; Subseries 3, Chile; Subseries 4, Venezuela; Subseries 5, Slides; Subseries 6, Negatives.</p>
          <p>Within each subseries, the files are arranged alphabetially by folder title. Each folder contains a separate, discrete set of pictures pertaining to an area of the AIA, and included within each folder is a list of numbered captions that correspond to the penciled numbers found on the lower right-hand corner on the back of the photographs. Often within the series pertaining to a specific country, the folders are broken down further into the country-specific organizations, separated by specific region withing the country (for example, Folder 172 is within Subseries 4, Venezuela, and is entitled "CBR [the specific organization], Barinas [the specific state of Venezuela], Crafts [the specific topic of the photographs]"). </p>
          <p>The Subseries 5, Slides and Subseries 6, Negatives do not posses captions and are therefore not numbered.</p>

The wife of Jose Alvarenga, borrower, is now boiling all of her drinking water, since the children were found to be suffering from worms and have received treatment from the ACAR doctor. 8. The kitchen of the wife of Antonio Adao is rather typical of the low-income family. The stove will be repaired, then the wall cleaned of smoke and grime, and a shelf built to accommodate pots and pans, etc. The first step was to start the family boiling water used for drinking and washing dishes.</p>

These cement blocks are made in large number by ACAR and purchased by all borrowers who need them. The block is placed over a pit and the house is built on top, at very little cost except $1.50 to $2.00 for the cement block. 49. This is the best type of outdoors toilet we find on the farms here. In most cases the parasites are spread widely. We are replacing these with new sanitary pit privys. Only 2 toilets of any type were found in this small town of Mucambeiro. 50.

              <p>1. Supervisor Pedreira examines (in his hand) the well rotted manure which applicant Jose Nicodemos Costa will use in his potatoes; he advises a small amount of supplemental fertilizer; and gives his general instruction for laying out the irrigation system for the dry season. Supervisor also influenced Jose not to burn off the litter on his land, but to work it into the ground to ass to the organic matter. Jose is a young man and is already profiting greatly in the technical service he is receiving even before the closing of his loan. 2. Applicant Jose Nicodemos Costa received word this day that his loan to cull and sell his poor cattle and purchase replacements of good milk stock, has been approved. Supervisor Pedreira, John J. Wilkey, farm management specialist, and applicant Jose look at his cattle to decide which should be culled out and sold. 3. Applicant Jose Nicodemos Costa upon advice of supervisor Pedreira did not wait for his loan to purchase this good purebred Guernsey bull. Guernseys probably survive the climate here better than other milk breeds, being also more resistant to the prevalent hoof and mouth disease. Pure bred USA milk cattle do not survive the climate here, but have to be mixed with native breeds in order to get a good milk production. Applicant Jose has not yet fully "made friends" with the bull, but he has confidence in the outcome.</p>

              <p>5. Sebastiao and Supervisor Gazzinelli discussing relative merits of hybrid corn over common corn. This is Sebastiao's first harvest of hybrid corn. 6. Borrower Batista Sergio da Silveira owned several cattle which he was going to have to sell in order to finance this production of squash which is a good money crop in Brazil. Batista is a good worker but he was living on rented land which was being sold and he was forced to buy a small part in order to remain on the place. The down payment on this land would have crippled his production without ACAR help. Under advice of supervisor Pedro Morais he has three plantings to better distribute work requirements and insure better market for his product. 7. Borrower Batista Sergio da Silveira chopping cane feed for his milk cows during the dry season when pastures are poor. The value of using such supplemental feed is being taught by ACAR supervisors and the construction of this mill was done under ACAR direction. It is powered by water. 8. Irish potatoes is a new crop for borrower Batista Sergio da Silveira. He has diversified his crop under the management plan of ACAR so that is any crop fails he has another source of income. He instructs his hired man in the correct planting. 9. Batista Sergio da Silveira examines, with supervisor Pedro Morais, the condition of the manure in the pit constructed and used under the advice of ACAR technicians. This is an important step of progress in the conservation of soil fertility, because the price of fertilizer renders its use uneconomical. 10. Some of the cattle purchased by Luiz Novy with the loan funds. These represent considerable improvement over the zebu cattle he had been milking. 11. This is one of the good young jersey cattle purchased by borrower Luiz Novy with loan funds. Borrowers are supervised closely in their purchases, and this cow shows considerable improvement over the zebu cattle in milk productions. 12. Luiz Novy had all his cattle vaccinated during a recent severe outbreak of black-leg. He has now learned to do his own vaccinating with materials provided by ACAR. 13. Herd bull purchased with ACAR loan. This sire is mixed zebu and Guernsey and represents a big improvement in this part of Brazil. This animal shows heavy "berne" infestation. 14. Supervisor Arnaldo Gazzinelli instructs borrower Sebastiao Onofre da Silveira on the culture of his young banana orchard.</p>

By posters, the grouping of price lists and literature explaining under which basic food groups Free Market produce falls, CIDEA is informing the public concerning the elements of popular diet. This trial cooperative program marked the opening of the new Mercado Libre, at Bella Vista. The pattern will be used for other Mercados Libres of Venezuela. 214. Bella Vista Market, Caracas, Venezuela (April 1950) Mercados Libres in Venezuela soon will offer the people benefiting by this Department of Agriculture food purveying programs, nutrition information to go with low cost basic foods. Here Sr, Samuel Rojas, CIDEA Mobile Units Officer, distributes basic information on balanced diets to early morning marketers in Bella Vista Market. The pattern adopted here will be extended to other regions of Venezuela as soon as possible. 215. Teenagers from the Anaco Oil Camp who are enrolled in the C.I.D.E.A. home economics classes, entertained guests at the official inauguration of the Cantuara Experimental Center April 27, 1949 with a skit on the seven basic foods of a good diest. 216. C.I.D.E.A's classes in cooking and child care have drawn a present enrollment of 106 wives and mothers from the oil town of Cantaura who are eager to learn how to improve the diet and health of their families.

              <p>1. The only Venezuelan wheat is grown on the temperate Andean slopes, and CBR economists have found that it seldom is a moneymaking crop. The farmers usually consume the flour themselves, paying for having it ground at primitive mills, such as the one shown, with a portion of the crop. 2. Brick and tile kilns are of various types and shapes as they exist in areas where clay products are fired in the Andes. Pictured is a relatively large kiln with fire box below the area where brick and tile are placed. 3. Generation of electricity has increased in the Andes during recent years. But most of the increase has been accomplished in small motor driven plants few of which are as large as the plant shown here at Valera. 4. A drug store located on the main street of the town of Santo Domingo, in the State of Merida is shown in this picture. In this store are sold not only medicinal products but also other articles of basic necessities. This lack of commercial specialization is characteristic of the small business establishments which are the predominant type in the Andean region. 5. Vegetables can be grown in the Andes in some areas and especially where irrigation water is available with a good comparative advantage over low tropical areas as far as quality and quantity of production is concerned. The better valley bottom soils could well be used for this purpose with good possibilities of reasonable economic return for the high labor and other cost input required for vegetables. 6. An illegal distillery of rudimentary construction, which was confiscated by the National Guards near Banco de Barinas in the southeast part of Tachira is shown in this picture. In the Andean region there are foreigners who try to augment their income through this illegal activity. In 1952, in the State of Tachira only, 836 illegal distilleries were discovered with an estimated average production of 40 meters per unit. 7. Pasture maintenance practices in many areas of the Andes still call for annual burning of old grasses as shown here above Palmira in Tachira. Considerable work is necessary in carrying out experiments in technological methods and in demonstrating improved practices to farmers so that unit productivity can be increased and destructive resource use diminished. 8. Very careful soil conservational practices are needed, including contour planting, strip cropping with permanent sod crops and other practices, for safe use of land with 30% slope as that pictured in the left hand side of this photo. An annual crop of field peas is shown. 9. Vegetable farming methods in the Andes still call for the use of the wooden plow and oxen for plowing. This field in Tachira in which a crop of cabbage and cauliflower had already been produced during the year was being prepared for a second crop of tomatoes and carrots. Some farmers attempt triple cropping during a season in this area. 10. The hand tools typically used in annual crop farm areas as well as most other types of farming are shown here. Notice the heavy "palas" leaned up against the box which are used both for digging and hoeing. The wedge shaped piece of metal on the box to the right of the shovel handle is an iron plow tip for use on the wooden plows. A few farmers use such tips but most plows are all wood. Notice the absence of the light type garden hoe which is easier to use than the heavy hoes and palas pictured for many hand operations in tilling crops. 11. Production of sugar cane on steep hillside areas in the Andes is common. However, most agronomists and cost conscious farmers believe that such production is uneconomic because of low yields and extra expenses of land preparation and harvesting on slope areas. Sugar cane does best on the level riverside areas where irrigation water is available and some mechanization of field operations can be accomplished. 12. Annual crops planted regularly on slopes as steep as that shown for the corn in this picture can do little else than destroy the top soil available. This slope is about 80 percent and it is common to see such steep slopes used for annual crops in the Andes. 13. Old style vertically mounted presses for extracting sugar cane juice are still found in use, especially on farms where the juice is used for guarapo rather than panels. Commercial producers of sugar cane usually have machine powered trapiches available. 14. Part of the dwellings are utilized for the limited processing of annual crops as shown here for tobacco. Seldom are special sheds facilities constructed for better control of the processing operations for any annual crops. 15. Livestock farmers ordinarily have to deliver their cattle for sale at central market areas. Buyers seldom come to the ranch to complete sales. Cattle are shown here en route over a jungle trail to a highway where they will be trucked to San Cristobal for sale. 16. The straight type "pala" is used most frequently for the hoeing vegetables. Shown here is a farmer hoeing and hilling up onions in the Flor Marin area of Tachira. 17. The wooden plow as pictured here is still used almost exclusively on annual crop farms and vegetable farms throughout the Andes. These plows will last two or three years when used for plowing three or four hectares per year. Two oxen are used to pull them. The steep slopes cultivated by Andean farmers preclude the use of any buy hand-wielded implements. 18. The Andean area is dependent on the Llanos areas for most of the livestock fattened or kept for dairy cows in the mountain areas. The picture shows a herd of cattle being driven through the Uribante valley en route to fattening zones in Tachira. 19. Planting sticks (coas) are used most frequently for planting corn and beans and some other crops on annual crop farms. Shown here is a man planting beans. Often two men work at planting. The first makes the hole with the stick and the second places the seeds and steps on the hole to cover them. 20. Cana Imperial is another improved soilage type grass which appears to do well in some livestock areas of the Andes as shown here near San Cristobal in Tachira. Greater use of improved pastures appears to be desirable development in many areas now used for annual crops but more information on cultural methods practical for the ecological conditions in the Andes is necessary. 21. After the burning process which was previously pictured the land is planted, in this case to corn, without further soil tilling in the shifting cultivation system of farming. The men in the picture are preparing to plant with a planning stick and a mattock for use in the steeper areas. 22. One of the few areas where small, one family livestock farms are prevalent in the Andes is located in the "caserio" of Sabana Grande in the State of Tachira. Pasture production in such high valley areas constitutes a more reasonable land use than annual crop production customary in many other zones with similar land resources. 23. After boiling down the sugar cane juice in from three to five vats the remaining sugar and molasses is molded in square cakes weighing about one pound as shown here. For shipping the panela is wrapped in banana or wild plantain type leaves usually with 96 cakes per pack or "bulto". Two of these packs make a "carga" for mule transport. 24. The outside view of a typical sugar cane trapiche used in the Andean area shows the heavy smokestack and the pile of bagasse which is used as fuel along with wood in the furnace heating the boiling vats. 25. The most frequently used sugar cane trapiche in the Andes is the three roller press pictured here. The sugar cane juice which can be seen coming out of the side of the machine passes through a tube to an adjoining room where the boiling vats are located which reduce the juice to panela. 26. Corn is usually dried before shelling at the house either by hanging the ears on racks as shown or spreading on the ground or hung with the husks on under eaves of houses. 27. Special drying facilities or mechanical shellers are very scarce in the Andes. Livestock care practices on farms are minimal in the Andes and one sees often animals badly infested with "nuche" as that shown here. Inexpensive contrils are known for the flies and the grubs which infest the animals but very few livestock farmers use such control methods and consequently both quality and quantity of livestock and livestock products suffer. 28. In areas where tree and brush growth is old one butting and burning does not clear the land and it must be done a second time. The unburned sticks have been stacked for better drying and the grass has been cut with machetes preparing for a second burning. 29. Planting of improved pasture grasses has been accomplished in several livestock farms in the Andes as illustrated by this field of Guinea Grass in Tachira. However, continuous experimentation to determine and demonstrate best cultural practices and varieties is not being accomplished now. 30. No caption. 31. Exploitation of lumber resources in the Andes is not of great economic importance at the present time. There are a few saw mills that are pictured either in the piedmont areas or some areas in the State of Merida at high altitudes. 32. Coal deposits near Lobatera are utilized to a limited extent by strip mining methods. Very few of the old hand operated mines are operating today. 33. A recently constructed cement plant between Palmira and Lobatera in Tachira is one of the largest industrial plants in the Andes. 34. Tile manufacturing plants with few exceptions are small businesses scattered in rural areas. Some farm people obtain off-farm employment in such plants as pictured here. 35. Andean miller grinds the wheat crop of Chachopo in Merida. The motif of the cross on the primitive apparatus is typical of this extremely religious community. 36. An Andean housewife prepares a meal much in the manner of her primitive forebears. This kitchen of Aristides Cardenas in the village of Flor Marin, is more elaborate than many in rural Venezuela where housewives do the cooking over simple "fogones", wood fires encircled by stones. 37. Skills are passed from one generation to another with the family. 38. Tobacco was one of the first well known expert crops from the Andes as far back as the 16th Century when colonization first started in the area. It is not of major importance economically for the region now but is still grown and processed in much the same way as it was done in colonial times. It is dried under the eaves of houses as shown in the photograph taken in the dry Chama Valley area below Merida. 39. The thatched roof and festoons of drying; tobacco give this Andean cottage a particularly shaggy look. 40. Coloncita is a typical village of the plains area of Tachira, below the Andes which rise sharply a bit farther west. It is located on the new Panamerican highway between La Fria and El Vigia, virgin territory which is being colonized rapidly since it's opening by the road. 41. A convite near San Miguel, locally organized for the purpose of building a camino vicinal. 42. The most frequent pattern of this distribution of the rural population in the Andes is the grouping of small houses into communities. The houses are grouped in the bottom of a valley, on the sides, or on the crest of a mountain and generally constitute a social community. In this photo we see, in the high Chama valley, some houses grouped on an alluvial fan, a very frequent location for the scattered communities of the high valleys of the Andes. 43. The photo shows an example of so-called "nomad farming", a practice common in the Venezuelan Andes. The farmer, who seldom own the lands and merely squats or share-crops, move from land where the soil is leached to another patch and allows that which he formerly farmed to lie fallow for a period. 44. No caption. 45. Demonstration of practices for the conservation of soil at Mucuchies. 46. Of the three crops universally raised by Andean farmers on their rugged, eroded slopes: corn, wheat and potatoes, CBR agricultural economist Louis Heaton says only potatoes yield a return, and it is neither secure nor rewarding. 47. Life is hard; the land is poor and the days are cold for the mountain dwellers in the high Venezuelan Andes. CBR economist knows that many of these farmers who crop their poor soil should turn their land to pasture and raise animals, but such conversion requires credit and technical training. 48. Farming is intensive and divided into small plots in the Merida mountain valley of Apartaderos. 49. This woman, another rope factory worker, twists the cords at one end while the young girl (whose photo is also included) winds it with a wheel. 50. A demonstrational supervised credit program has been carried on in Tachira with the Banco Agricola y Pecuario collaborating with CBR this week. Shown in the picture is a CBR supervisor discussing with a farmer production and marketing problems as a follow-up on the annual farm and home plan which has been prepared by the farmer with the aid of the technician.</p>

              <p>51. The central market locations in the Andean area have not developed special facilities for parking or loading platform spaces so truck drivers are forced to use congested street areas for loading and unloading agricultural products brought to the market area either for local sale or transshipment to other market areas. The picture shows a street near the Municipal market in San Cristobal. 52. A commercial dry goods store typical of the area and located in a town in the State of Tachira is shown in this picture. Most of the stores in the Andean region are made up on small establishments usually "one-man businesses" characterized by their limited use of capital and the lack of specialization in the commercial and retail functions. 53. The small "pulperia" is the retail outlet me frequently found in the Andes. These stores sell dried and canned foods, hardware, and clothing, tobacco, and numerous other items. These usually have limited stocks and are run by one family. 54. This Mucuchies sheep farmer is carrying his prize to market while his wife leads two others. 55. An Andean street scene in the town of Santo Domingo, high in the mountains of the state of Merida. 56. The millers of Chachopo is a versatile citizen; he spins and weaves the tough fabric for making the familiar Venezuelan "alpargato" or sandal which is worn throughout the country as a sideline to grinding the wheat of his neighbors. 57. This is an old sugar mill still operating at Mendoz Fria in the state of Trijillo. 58. No caption. 59. Among the present Andean huts constructed by the farmers of this high valley of the state of Merida, many are similar to those built by the old Timotes Indians. In spite of strong Spanish influence and the total disappearance of the Indian in the Andes, the pre-Colombian cultural characteristics still maintained in the region are quite noticeable. 60. Clay is also utilized for making vases by hand methods. The photograph shows one of these rudimentary home industries located at La Ovejera, one of the most arid and eroded zones in the Andes, in the Capacho District, State of Tachira. 61. The "unchanging" Andes. 62. Roads have been improved a great deal in the Andes in recent years. However, access roads to many farm areas are still not available so dependence on expensive mule transportation is still necessary. A "recua" of mules laden with coffee and panela are shown entering Bailadores after a day and a half trip from Southern Merida. 63. The Agricultural and Livestock Bank (BAP) is one of the official organizations whose object is to finance farmers through the concession of credit under liberal terms and in adequate amounts required for agricultural production. This photo shows the entrance to a branch of this institution which is established in San Cristobal. 64. At Escaguey on the Chama River above Merida, is located the largest flour mill in the Andes which is a private business engaged in the manufacture of macaroni products in addition to milling flour. 65. Hides are processed into leather at a fairly well mechanized tannery at San Cristobal. The men are shown selecting the finished tanned hides which will be rolled up and sold to various leather working shops mostly in the Andean Area. 66. Slaughter of beef is usually done in Municipo owned slaughter houses. However, in the small villages slaughter for community use is done without any special facilities as show here. As pictured here, the beef was killed, dressed, cut up and sold on the ground with the hide serving as the table and sales counter. All that was left when the picture was taken was the hide and the offal which the owner carried back to his farm. 67. Home conveniences are few in most Andean homes both in the Tropical Valleys in the piedmont areas and in the high cold areas. Pictured are the kitchen facilities in a home in the Uribante Valley area which is not unusual. Many women in all areas of the Andes have to cook over open fires on the floor. Others have a stone platform on which the open fire is built. Others have kerosene stoves whose use has increased in recent years. 68. The minifundial system perpetuates a low level of living. This choza is located on the Loma of San Miguel in Turjillo. 69. On farm marketing is seldom possible on Andean annual crop farms and a great deal of time is expended in taking small lots of products to towns for sale usually to merchants. Pictured is a burro loaded with yucca and corn with two members of farm family going to market. It required a full day for these two persons to market less than Bs 30 worth of product. 70. On farm marketing of vegetables is not practiced to any great extent in the Andes. Mules are used most frequently to carry products to the town markets for sale. Pictured are a group of farmers each with one mule and a load of onions going to the free market at Independencia, Tachira. 71. No caption. 72. A critical need still exists for more access roads from the through trunk highways to farm areas. Pictured is short section of road built by the cooperative action of a group of farmers in Tachira who by the joint expenditure of labor and some funds to construct less than a kilometer of access road were able to reduce greatly the number of mules they had to maintain on their small farms to haul coffee and other products to market. It also made it possible for more of the children in the area to go to school and participate in other community affairs. 73. View of the railroad station at La Fria on the railroad between Encontrados and Estacion Tachira. Even though the value of cargo transported by railroad of the region was important in the past, the competition of trucks has substantially reduced the traffic of merchandize and passengers by this means of transportation. Already the railroad between La Ceiba and Motatan in the State of Trujillo has been paralyzed and abandoned. 74. Due to the opening of new communication routes and the improvement and increase in the number of automotive vehicles, there has been a considerable decrease in freight rates on the roads in the Andean region. However, the lack of total access roads still makes it necessary to transport the agricultural products from many areas by muleback. This reduces and in some cases nullifies the advantages of the Andean economy represented by the progress in ways and means of road transportation. 75. The tannery plant at San Cristobal as shown in this interior view has machinery and vats for handling a significant volume of hides. 76. No caption. 77. Long use of steep slope lands for annual crops has brought about erosion problems which have attracted government programs for control. Pictured are contour stone fences constructed under government sponsorship in a demonstration area near Mucuchies, Merida. Strip cropping with permanent sod crops are usually necessary for soil conservation on slope lands used for annual crops but such is seldom practiced in the Andes. 78. In the foreground to the left may be seen an example of erosion frequently found in the Andean farmland. CBR economists consider that much land now cropped should be turned to pasture, but such conversion requires technical advice and credit. 79. A large number of the rural Andean population still moves about on foot or muleback and continues to use the old roads and bridges which are usually in bad condition. In such a rugged region as the Andes, where roads are still undeveloped and the population scattered through the mountains, mule trails continue to be the most frequent means of communication, although slow and expensive. 80. A primitive Andean bridge crosses a mountain stream near Mucuraba in Merida. 81. Each populated zone in the Andean region has stimulated the development of an urban agglomeration which functions as the political, commercial, and cultural center of the area. The capitals of Tachira and Merida, for example, are together with Valera in Trujillo, the main focus of their own states and the other important populated zones which exist within each state area are secondary center of a part of the State. Tovar, seen in this photo, is a typical example of a secondary urban center which in this case serves as the focus of the western section of the state of Merida. 82. Tovar is a typical Andean town, tile-roofed and clustered around a central plaza with a handsome colonial cathedral. 83. The Free Market at Tachira. Tachira is a busy place on the one day a week it operates. Such free markets are located at nine other locations in the Andes and are sponsored by the Ministry of Agriculture. 84. Road improvements along main routes are shortening the transportation time between the Andes and the large cities in Venezuela. The new road along the Llanos states of Cojedes, Portuguesa and Barinas with a tie-in road to the Transandean highway through Barinitas and Santo Domingo in Merida as shown in this picture is very helpful in this respect. 85. Newly cut roads in steep mountain country are difficult to maintain because of slides and washouts. The section pictured on the Barinitas - Santo Domingo road in Merida paralyzes traffic occasionally creating problems of spoilage of perishable agricultural products. 86. The Transportation highway has been widened and improved in many areas in recent years but the spectacular switchbacks are still necessary on both sides of the high paramo areas. 87. A policy of price and support is operative for a few products in the Andes charged to the Banco Agricola y Pecuario. The illustrated notice was well distributed in areas where Bank agencies were functioning. However, in the case of corn for the 1952 and 1953 crops the Bank was unable to buy all the corn offered because of lack of facilities to handle the corn and many farmers had to take prices almost half the support price to get rid of their crop. 88. Half of the Andean region is still covered with forest and even within the populated areas large extensions of land with little population remain. This aerial photograph of a zone between La Fundation and Los Naranjos, along the Uribante river, represents one of the typical populated areas of low density where the scattered "conucos" and "potreros" leave to the forest at least 50% of the land. 89. In the valley of the Motatan river, near Chachopo, Merida, there are three wheat mills at work. They are rudimentary and of small capacity and this is where the farmers transform their cereal into whole wheat flour before selling it. In payment for their service, the mills take a share of the wheat equivalent to 80% of the total wheat milled (4kgs out of each 50kgs). The photograph shows the primitive stone wheel turned by water power which is used as the grinding device in these mills. 90. The "frailejon" plant is identified with the Andean Paramo areas. Its bunches of silvery white leaves can be seen for great distances. Other planes growing at these high altitudes are all stunted type shrubs and convey the impression of the high areas above 3000 meters altitude and often describe a large part of the Andean area based on this impression. 91. Towns and villages constitute a different type of rural agglomeration but are not too frequent in the Andes. Outside of the municipio capitals these agglomerations are generally few. Situated at strategic points they serve as focus for the farmers who live in the immediate surroundings. As in Peribeca, small village in the Capacho district which appears in this photo, a grouping of this type includes a church, a school, a dispensary and some small commercial establishments. 92. The construction of a road into the San Camilo forest in the southern part of the State of Tachira recently caused a heavy migration of Andean farm families towards these plains at the foot of the mountain range. Begun 10 years ago this road was continued in 1952 and 1953 and it was then that it produced its attraction. As one can see, in the two comparative drawings in Map #11, the farmers construct their houses along the new road and rapidly deforest the land. 93. The alluvial terraces constitute together with the riverside areas most of the level land existing in the Andes. These mesas composed in part by materials of glacial origin are sometimes fertile and cultivatable even though they are rocky. The land near Timotes, which appears in this photo, is generally utilized for the production of annual field crops and vegetables and also for pasture. From the bed of the River Motatan one can see the successive terraces raising like giant stairways. 94. A shifting cultivation farm is pictured here in the Santo Domingo river valley, Merida, showing the small patch of corn and the various other patches of abandoned land with brush growth from two to fifteen years of age which will be cleared in succession for later crops. 95. Part of the land preparation for planting on a shifting cultivation form is shown here. The brush and trees have been previously cut after an expenditure of many days of human labor and the area is being burned to remove the dried brush and trees as well as much of the organic layer developed on the soil by the plant growth over a period of several years. 96. Where fairly large stumps are left which are difficult to cut out by hand the crop is planted among the stumps as shown in this picture for a shifting cultivation farm. 97. Small areas in the Capacho district of Tachira are devoted to the production of vegetables. Pictured here in the foreground is cabbage and on the mesa farther back are beds of onions and garlic. 98. The excessive fragmentation of annual crop farms can be seen in this picture. Five farm families are dependent on about 6 hectares of crop land for their livelihood in this scene in the Capacho district of Tachira. 99. While scientific seed selection to develop varieties of annual crops adapted for Andean conditions are not being continuously carried on a natural selection has developed a dwarf type of corn which is produced in some of the higher altitude areas where other cricolla varieties will not produce. Pictured are a few plants of this dwarf variety near Bailadores, Merida. 100. Annual crop farms in the lower altitude areas, as that shown here for a farm in the Capacho District of Tachira, usually use a larger portion of the total land area each year than do such farms at higher altitudes. The period of land rest between crops is less at the lower and warmer altitudes. The pictured farm is using about one-half of the available crop land each year.</p>

              <p>101. Corn and bean are often inter-planted as shown here on annual crop farms in the Andes. A volunteer squash plant also shows in this picture which got into this field by accident. 102. In a few locations in the Andes as shown here for a farm near Tovar, Merida, pasture production has already replaced steep slope annual crop farming. On slopes as abrupt as those shown a permanent type crop is much desirable than crops requiring annual plowing which the pictured area was previously subjected to. 103. The better sugar cane production areas in the perennial cash crop system of farming are located in the more level valley bottoms where irrigation water can be used. Pictured is the Momboy river valley from La Puerta looking down valley toward Mendoza Fria and Valera which is one of the larger and most intensive sugar cane producing areas in the Andes. 104. Systematic pruning of coffee plants to control the size of the plant and encourage new week growth which bears the crop is seldom done in the Andes. Pictured is a typical grove in which the coffee plants have never been pruned and volunteer plants between the original plantings have been allowed to grow making weeding and harvesting operations more difficult and expensive. 105. Shifting cultivation of annual crops is carried on usually in relatively inaccessible areas where land is at a minimum. It can be recognized by the patchy appearance as shown in the accompanying photo. Actual crop areas are small and the abandoned land shows brush at various stages of growth indicating the shifting use and the long time land rotation use practiced. 106. The trend of gradual withdrawal of some land from cropping use in the Andes is most dramatically seen in the old Capacho area in the State of Tachira. The slopes in the distance formerly were used for cropping and pastures but today have been completely abandoned because continual cropping to soil depleting crops and erosion have destroyed its productivity. 107. Attempts to grow coffee, the most important perennial cash crop in the Andes, without shade have generally proved unsuccessful. Pictured are coffee plants which made good initial growth in an area with high incidence of cloudy days but failed to withstand the direct rays of the sun for a few extended periods and had to be abandoned. 108. Today there is still a great lack of secondary and rural access roads to connect the whole rural Andean population with the main roads and cities of the region. Construction of such access roads is difficult in view of the ruggedness of the Andes but it is indispensable in order to integrate into the Andean economy the numerous isolated agricultural zones which still exist in the area. In the southeastern part of Tachira and southwestern part of Merida, for example, there are some 55,000 inhabitants in urgent need of secondary and rural access roads. 109. There are two modern refrigerated storage plants in the Andes belonging to the Agricultural and Livestock Bank. However, there are not utilized in an efficient manner. Even then the markets are really flooded and products are spoiling the refrigerated storage space goes unutilized. The market gluts which occur indicate the need for storage facilities to stabilize prices by equaling supply and demand but so far the facilities available have not been made to work. 110. Many vegetable farmers carry their products to market in sacks and boxes utilizing the autobuses that travel the main roads. Pictured is a bus with vegetables and other crops loaded on top going to Merida. The products on top belonged to nine different farmers all of whom were inside the bus taking a full day to market their small lots of products. 111. The Panamerican Highway, is the western part of VE, has been constructed at the very root of the Andes. It runs along through the low lands which extend from the mountains towards the Lake of Maracaibo. This modern highway will reduce to almost half the time required to travel from many Andean zones to Maracaibo, Barquisimeto or Caracas. The above photo shows one of the solid bridges which were being constructed over the numerous rivers this road must cross. 112. If it is difficult to construct and maintain roads in the mountain area of the Andes, their construction at the foot of these mountains is also complicated. Numerous rivers, many of them very wide, flow from the mountain range and in the rainy season they swell and become very dangerous. The construction of the Panamerican Highway on the northern part of the Andes has to face these problems. Here, at the south end of the VE Andes, we see a bridge over the Chururu River which was destroyed by a flood. 113. Until some 30 years ago roads had not penetrated the Andes. The mule and the horse were since the Conquest the only fast means of transportation available. The traveler needed then nearly a full week to cross the Andes from one end to the other. 114. The Transandean highway was constructed over 20 years ago and has been considerably improved during recent years. However, because of the rough terrain of the area there are still many switchbacks and steep grades as pictured here which, are a trial to travelers, especially to truck drivers who continually pass over this road. 115. The high altitude wheat growing area around Apartaderos in Merida is characterized by the very limited bush and tree vegetation and the solid stone walls built with rocks as they were cleared from the fields. Wheat has been grown in many of these areas for almost 400 years and the rock and pressed earth wall construction of the houses in the area give an impression of permanence achieved through hard work by the people residing there. The darker colored patches in the photograph are potato fields. 116. The boundary line between the states of Trujillo and Merida as it exists today in the Motatan River valley just above the town of La Mesa de Renujaque shown here was set long before the present state areas were established. It was in 1559 that Maldonado leading the expedition for the province of Nueva Granada and Captain Francisco Ruiz representing the old province of VE met in the area shown in the photograph. The point at which they met was agreed upon was a dividing line between the two old provinces and it was reestablished as the boundary between Trujillo and Merida in 1899. 117. Valera is one of the more recent cities founded in the Andes but it has grown rapidly and is now one of the three largest cities in the region. It was founded in 1817 and is now the largest market and service area for Turjillo. The photograph shows the city as it is located at the junction of the Motatan and Momboy Rivers which then flow on into Lake Maracaibo. 118. Production of annual crops are carried on even on steep slopes in the Andes without use of soil protecting practices. In spite of this some areas, as that shown in the photograph for valley above Bailadores in Merida have continued with this type of production, but with generally reducing yields for many years. 119. During the glacial periods of the Pleistocene the summits of the VE Andes were covered by glaciers. The sharp peaks, the extensive rock surfaces, the lakes, the U-shaped valley, the moraines and the erratic material that we observe today in the paramos are the products of this old glacial activity. As we can see in this photo of Pico Bolivar, such activity has been beneficial because of the great beauty it has given to the Andean landscape. 120. In the western part of Tachira the Andes suddenly lose their extremely abrupt topography to become a region of low mountains which rarely rise above 2,000 meters. Known as the "depression de Tachira" this densely populated zone is characterized by softer relief and gentler slopes then most of the Andean region. 121. The great longitudinal valleys of the Andes are one of the major characteristics of the region. The Momboy valley, seen in the photo above, runs in a straight line parallel to the Motatan valley, directed toward Valera. Its bottom is quite flat and has a fertile soil which is almost entirely occupied by sugar cane. La Puerta and Mendoza Fria are the only two and ancient towns which exist in this picturesque valley. 122. The Caparo River, which serves as boundary between the states of Barinas, Merida, and Tachira, receives the waters of an extensive region at the southeastern part of Merida. The Aricagua, Mucupati, Mucuchachi, Guaimaral, and Camburito Rivers are the largest tributaries which feed the Caparo river in the Andes before it slides slowly through the Llanos in search of the Apure. In this photo we see the imposing Caparo River across from Canton, in the extreme southeastern side of Tachira, near the spot where the new highway goes through to Guasdualito. 123. The Upper Chama Valley is flanked by the "Sierra Nevada" on the south and the "Sierra del Norte" on the north. These two ridges rise with crests over 4,000 meters whose serrated peaks sprout from the "paramo" among hundred of lakes. Here we see, at the foot of the Sierra Nevada, the town of Apartaderos, at 3,310 meters altitude, whose population is chiefly dedicated to planting wheat and potatoes. 124. The Chama Valley transforms itself, below Ejido, into a true desert which extends over 30 kilometers as far as Estanques. The very dry climate, the xerophytic vegetation, the extremely eroded and desiccated lands of this part of the Chama Valley are characteristic of what man's activities have originated and the goats have worsened. 125. The Motatan River has its source at the Paramo de Mucuchies and runs through a narrow and straight valley before it leaves the mountains near the city of Valera. Here we note the high valley of the Motatan, in the vicinity of Chachopo and La Venta, where the impetuous waters of the river descend by jumps, while alongside it the Transandean Highway rises slowly towards the "Paso del Aguila". 126. The Andes present great contrast in climate and vegetation, not only vertically but also horizontally. In the midst of this humid area, suddenly appear dry and very dry valleys whose scarce xerophytic vegetation contrasts with the dense tropical forests found in the vicinity. Such arid islands appear generally because the winds from the Lake of Maracaibo and the Llanos lost their humidity as they pass the first mountains and as they reach these valleys they cannot produce rain and, besides, may have a drying effect. It can be estimated that valleys of this type have a dry season of about 7 months or more. 127. The flat and gently sloping lands are very scarce in the Andes. They are usually found at the bottom of longitudinal valleys, in the vegas, terraces, and alluvial fans. The upper Chama Valley that we see in this photograph is one of the few Andean valleys that have an extensive gently sloping bottom. 128. San Cristobal, seen in this photo, was founded in the year 1561. After three centuries of existence this colonial city was still not bigger than a town of 3,000 inhabitants: less important in Tachira than La Grita and Lobatera. Its commercial and industrial development, accelerated by the construction of railroads, and especially by the Transandean highway, caused and continue to cause rapid growth of the population of the capital of Tachira. San Cristobal, in 1950, had 56,073 inhabitants, having by then reached the category of the most important urban center of the Andean region. 129. The humid tropical forests of the Andes extend chiefly through the piedmont and lower valleys of the north and southwestern part of the region. The humid, westerly winds from the plains, strike the mountains in these parts and are forced upward where condensation occurs and heavy rainfalls are frequent. The annual rainfall in these zones varies between 2,000 and 4,000 mm, but the rains are interrupted almost completely during the three-month dry season. The palm trees (Maximiliana sp.) are the clearest indication of these wet tropical forest formations which are made up of more than 100 species in the better soil areas. 130. From the ancient and extensive alluvial terraces of Santo Domingo, in the southeastern part of Tachira, there is a beautiful panoramic view over the Uribante plains which unfolds at the foot of the Andes. Further down from Santo Domingo there plains are still almost totally covered by the San Camilo forest, which extends towards the east for more then 80Kms before it makes way for the savannahs of Barinas and Apure. 131. Manufacture of ceramics is still a part of home industry. 132. A cash economy brings with it the beginning of a laboring class in the Andes. 133. The Bocono valley has a humid, subtropical climate sure to its altitude and position. This climatic factor has had great influence in the development of local coffee industry which makes the place one of the most important coffee centers of the Andes. The town of Bocono is found within this zone. Found in 1763, Bocono, shown in this photo, now has a population of 5,600 inhabitants. 134. No caption. 135. Members of a household in the high Andes. 136. Vegetable production is not carried out in large areas in the Andes but constitutes an intensive land use which can utilize the small irregular shaped patches of good soil encountered in valley bottoms in the area. With proper production methods vegetables yield a good return for the high labor expenditure required and the Andean region has some ecological advantages for vegetable crops over many of the lower tropical areas in VE. 137. Cattle production is the preponderant livestock industry in the Andes and other types of livestock have little economic importance now. Pictured is a herd of Llanos cattle which were brought to a farm in Tachira for grass fattening before going to market. 138. Production of bananas and platanos is carried on extensively in the Andes, especially in the tropical valleys at low altitudes leading from the mountains. Loading of platanos in the vicinity of La Fria for shipment to San Cristobal is pictured. 139. The Trans-Andean highway has made the Andes more accessible to the outside world. 140. The extolling of commercial products leads to greater confusions and frustrations. 141. This miller in Chachopo also weaves bindings for alpargatas. 142. Some were sought by Heaven as angelitos. 143. Barbering is done at home. 144. The parish priest speaks with pride of los Andinos Fanaticos. 145. Child with a charm against mal de ojo. 146. Arepa de trigo, the basic food item of the Andes. 147. A horse in the Andes is a sign of wealth. 148. Anti bodies are administered indiscriminately by untrained persons. 149. Taking produce to market. 150. Distances formerly measured in terms of mule-days are now measured in hours.</p>

              <p>151. "Se ganan algunas lochas por la familia". 152. Old stone wheel coffee mills for thrashing coffee which has been dried with the pulp on are used in many areas where "parapara" coffee is still produced. The more acceptable processing method where the coffee is de-pulped and washed before drying has been adopted rapidly in the limited areas where the Campana Cafeteria has been operating. 153. Local looming of the ruanas has virtually come to a standstill. 154. Firewood offered for sale in Egido, Merida. 155. Farm operations are very rudimentary in many sections of the Andes. Pictured is a thrashing floor where wheat is trampled out by the horses, the straw is tossed aside with forks and then the chaff is separated by tossing the wheat and chaff into the air where breezes blow the chaff to the side and the wheat falls back to the thrashing floor. 156.

Part of the course offered the young women, all employs of rural health units in Aragua, concerns the construction of rudimentary furniture from packing crates etc. 79. Learning to wield a saw in a class for constructing rudimentary furniture is only one part of the extensive home improvement course, offered to nurses' aides of the Aragua State Health Service by home economists of the Consejo de Bienstar Rural. The girls also are taught sewing and the adaptation of feed sacks and other readily available materials to the family clothing needs; cooking and preserving of food and arrangement of proper diets and community organization, including the founding of women's and girl's clubs. 80. Construction of useful household objects from waste material-the two girls are painting a garbage container made from a discarded oil tin-and household furniture from scrap lumber long has been a part of the CBR home demonstration program. The young staff of the "Cacique Charaima" school want to incorporate it in their community education program and secured the aid of CBR home demonstration training director Elba Velez to establish such a course. 81.

              <p>1. This Guarico farmer is clearing the sperture into the "bacaquero" (ant hill) in preparation for filling it with the chlorodane spray. Such any hills are found frequently in corn fields near Calabozo. 2. This Guarico farmer applies the spray directly into the opening of the ant hill, thereby effectively eliminating a large number of the destructive red ants which infest his corn field near Calabozo. 3. This Guarico farmer applies the spray directly into the opening of the ant hill, thereby effectively eliminating a large number of the destructive red ants which infest his corn field near Calabozo. 4. A Ministry of Agriculture demonstrator sets out for a Guarico corn field with a can of chlorodane spray packed on his back. His job is to show farmers of the Calabozo area in Guarico how to spray the bachacos (red ants) which attack their crops. 5. This farmer had bought a supply if insecticide from the Guarico office of Banco Agricola &amp; Pecuaria in Calabozo and is paying for his purchase. 6. Farmers attending the course in operation of equipment offered by CBR technicians in Guarico learn to care for the expensive machines they handle. 7. This Guarico farmer has drenched the "bachaqueros" (ant hills) inhabited by the destructive VE red ants; now he is dousing the "roads" which they have built from the ant hills to the corn plants. 8. The famous VE bachacos (red ants) destroyed one-tenth of this corn crop on a farm near Calabozo in Guarico. 9. A pair of bachacos are having themselves a feast on this corn leaf in a field near Calabozo. 10. Here the camera of Paul Meyn has penetrated the privacy of a bachaco road, leading from the any hill to the corn field on a farm near Calabozo, state of Guarico. 12. Those VE bachacos have a formidable appetite. Look at what they have done to a tree trunk on a farm near Calabozo, Guarico. 13. This is the bachaquero where a large community of the marauding red ants of Guarico have established headquarters. This shot was taken on a farm near Calabozo. This indicates just how large the bachaqueros really are. The photo was taken on a farm near Calabozo. 14. Here is a queen bachaco leaving the nest to celebrate her nuptials. This photo was taken on a farm near Calabozo. 15. This shows just how large the bachaco queen is. She still had her wings which she will lose shortly after breeding. The photo was taken on a farm near Calabozo. 16. Here is a male bachaco of the class dedicated to breeding. The photo was taken on a farm near Calabozo. 17. Here is a male breeder and two "soldier" bachacos. The former is a dilettante, and the latter do the work. 18. Here is a sampling of the entire bachacos family: in the foreground is an unbred queen - she still has her wings; behind her is her more experiences, wingless sister; the second winged apt is the breeding male; beside him is a dead, wingless male; the largest ant is a "soldier", and the two small ants are "slaves". The photo was taken on a farm near Calabozo, Guarico. 19. The regional branches of Banco Agricola y Pecuaria (Farmers and Stockmen's Bank) stock insecticides for exterminating the bachaco. Here an agent is discussing the product with a prospective buyer in Calabozo. 20. This farmer has bought a supply of insecticide from the Guarico office of Banco Agricola y Pecuaria in Calabozo and is paying for his purchase. 21. The chlorodane liquid is shot directly into the "bachaquero", headquarters of a marauding band of red ants which attack the corn fields in the region of Calabozo. 22. In addition to spraying directly into the opening of the ant hill, it was recommended to the farmers that they also spray the area around each "bachaquero", as the farmer is shown doing here in his corn field near Calabozo. 23. Another chlorodane bath is given the bachacos which infest the corn fields near Calabozo. 24. Guarico farm worker sign up for the course in the operation of farm equipment at the office of the Ministry of Agriculture veterinarian in Calabozo. 25. The central shop of the tractor-training course established at Galpon in Guarico is equipped with a full set of mechanics tools in the event a piece of training equipment needs repair. CBR technicians are assisting the Ministry of Agriculture in offering the course. 26. Maintenance of the machinery is a primary concern of students attending the course in operation of farm equipment offered by CBR technicians in Guarico. 27. This student is taking a hose to the disk attachment for his tractor. Part of the course in operation of farm equipment offered by CBR technicians in the state of Guarico consists in learning systematic methods for care and maintenance of the machinery. 28. This "tractorista" is checking the motor of his vehicle before giving it a practice run on the field at Galpon, Guarica. 29. CBR technicians and students look on while one budding "tractorista" takes his tuen for a trial operation of the machine. The course was offered at Galpon in Guarico. 30. Dr. Sanchez Medina, Director of Agriculture for the Ministry of Agriculture (right) and Capt. Navarro, representative of the state of Guarico, officiate at the presentation of diplomas to the first class of tractor operators to be graduate from the Agricultural Training Center operated by CBR technicians for the Ministry. 31. Howard Law, CBR technician, delivers a diploma to one of the first group to complete the course in this operation of farm machinery offered at Galpon in Guarico. 32. On the truck bed are officials of the Ministry of Agriculture, Guarico government representatives and CBR technicians, all participants in the presentation of diplomas to the first group of farmers to complete the course offered in the operation of farm equipment at Galpon, Guarico. 33. This is a field in the state of Guarico during the rainy season. In the dry season, this same field is parched and cracked. To eliminate such extremes, the VE government is building the giant Guarico dam. 34. This is a typical field near Calabozo. The big Guarico River dam, which the VE government now is constructing will provide a reservoir for collecting such water as run-off and will store it until the subsequent dry season, when such fields as the one shown become parched and cracked from lack of moisture. 35. This is a Guarico rice field. 36. Heavy rains have caused extensive erosion in this Guarico field. 37. This corn field has suffered greatly from an infestation of the army worm. 38. Considerable stirring is necessary to mix the chlorodane powder with water to be used as a spray against the ravenous bachacos which infest the corn fields of Guarico. 39. If a mechanical sprayer is unobtainable, the Guarico farmer can resort to a good-sized tin can with holes punched in the bottom. Such an improvised sprayer is demonstrated by this farmer in ridding his corn field near Calabozo of the destructive "bachacos". 40. Here the farmer is preparing chlorodane mixture for spraying his field against the bachaco. The photo was taken at a farm home near Calabozo in Guarico. 41. This Guarico farmer now has a diploma which states that he is qualified to operate a tractor and the various attachments used with it. He was among the first group to complete the farm equipment operation course offered by CBR technicians for the Ministry of Agriculture. 42. Children help themselves at the Yagua community center milk station. Volunteer mothers prepare the food, donated by the state, for serving fifty children daily.</p>

              <p>178. The electric microsol sprayer brings comfort to animals tormented by insects and parasites and results in happier, healthier cows, an increased milk supply and consequent gains for the dairyman. 179. Troublesome parasites are destroyed by a close-range spraying. These pests can so annoy a cow that she will lose weight, and her milk supply will be jeopardized. 180. The electric microsol sprayer is effectively employed in this dairy barn, one of the more modern installations in the area known as the Caracas milkshed. The photo was taken during a study made of the Caracas dairy supply area by Dr. J.B. Frye for CBR. 181. No caption. 182. No caption. 183. No caption.</p>

Esta tierra de primera clase, situada en Guataparo, tiene un canal que bordea la finca y, sin embargo, permanece sin desarrollar. 215. Esta finca de Taiguaiguay ha sido habilitada para el cultivo, pero no se ha nivelado. Su valor aumentaria considerablemente con una nivelacin adecuada. 216. Fincas de Suata cultivadas intensivamente. Esta tierra es de un valor muy elevado, y el gasto realizado en acondicionarla para el riego puede recupararse en uno o dos aos. 217. Esta es una tierra de buena calidad, situada en la parte inferior del Proyecto de Suata, la cual solamente produce pastos en manchas diseminadas, debido a la falta de drenaje. 218. Tierra falta de drenaje en el Proyecto de Suata, la cual tendria un also valor si fuese devidamente nivelada. 219.

Seccin de un canal secundario de concreto, en el Proyecto de Taiguaiguay, hundido y resquebrajado, debido a que el terreno se sent despues de haberse sometido al regadio. 234. Ejemplo de erosion de mrgenes en un canal del Proyecto de Guataparo. 235. Esta cosecha no justificaria el pago de ninguna contribucin por concepto de uso de agua. Con un riego adecuado, podrian producirse en esta tierra muy buenas cosechas. 236. Este comap ha sido preparado para pagar con holgura las contribuciones por el use del agua. 237. Campos que muestran cosechas exelentes, con las cuales podrian satisfacerse las contribuciones para el pago de los costos de operacin y mantenimiento, asi como los de construccin del proyecto. 238. Vista de la represa de Guataparo, tomada desde su parte inferior. 239. Parte superior de la represa de Guataparo. Obsrvese su tamao relativamente pequeo con relacin a la gran capacidad de almacenamiento de agua del embalse. 240. Vista del embalse. Este proyecto cuenta con un excelente abastecimiento de agua. 241. Canal de concreto. Este sistema de canales es costoso, pero despus de terminado, los costos de mantenimiento son bajos y su eficiencia para la distribucin del agua des elevada. 242. Aliviadero para proteccin del canal principal. 243. Escaln de caida del agua en un canal decundario, que sirve para reducer el declive del canal, con el fin de evitar la erosin. 244. En los pastos bajo riego puede mantenerse el Ganado vacuno durante la temporada en que los dems potreros estn secos. De esta manera, el crecimiento del ganado es continuo durante todo el ao. 245. El ganado vacuno lechero de alta calidad puede alimentarse con forraje verde cortado y mantenerse durante todo el ao en potreros con regadio. 246. Los pastos bien regados pueden ser un cultivo del mayor valor cuando se utilizan para alimentar ganado de buena calidad. 247. Finca con suelo de alta calidad, cuya cosecha se ha perdido por falta de un sistema apropiado de riego y drenaje. 248. Campo nivelado convenientemente para el riego y el drenaje, el cual puede ser trabajado eficientemente con maquinaria. 249. He aqu dos campos de caa de azcar, uno de 14 meses y otro de 3 meses. Con un riego apropiado se hace posible la recoleccin continua. </p>

              <p>1. Mr. Lynne Blum, Superintendent of the INLACA plant of Valencia, makes the rounds to check on automatic milk fillers which turn out cartons at the rate of 35 per minute. 2. Flash pasteurizer installed in the INLACA plant at Valencia doubled to 35, 000 quarts daily the output capacity of the plant. 3. E.G. Van Wagner (center), General Manager of the VBEC, founded by Nelson A. Rockefeller and his brothers, says farewell to Edward Kimball (left), resigning manager of VBEC's successful pasteurized milk company, INLACA and good luck to Prudencio Moure (right), the new manager. Both Kimball and Moure are from Florida. 4. Venezuelan youngster grasps new safeguard for his health. The sanitary paper milk carton, introduced to VE by INLACA, is automatically sealed with paraffin, protecting children against the practice of dilution of milk in interval between plant and consumer. By lending technical assistance to dairy farmers, providing them with a steady, year-round market for their produce, and setting up an effective milk distribution system, INLACA is attempting to increase milk production and consumption in VE, thus bringing larger quantities of this basic food into the diets of the people and lowering infant mortality rates. 5. As part of Nutrition Week in the state of Carabobo, the Superintendent of Education, district supervisors and the CIDEA representative in Carabobo carried out programs relative to Nutrition Education. INLACA cooperated in the nutrition education programs by supplying, through the CIDEA representative, a sufficient amount of milk for all schools in Valencia, Flor Amarilla and Los Guayos. In the above picture, masks of CARALIN, the Leche Carabobo cow, were distributed to school children along with milk. 6.

In the above picture, masks of CARALIN, the Leche Carabobo cow, were distributed to school children along with milk. 8. Business got too bigso VBEC remodeled the old INLACA milk pasteurizing plant in Valencia, state of Carabobo, more than doubling the floor space and turning this handsome new faade to busy Avenida Michelena. 9. Watch the Milk Go Around! These complicated machines do everything but drink the milk, and of course that's the one thing everyone wants to do for himself. They assemble the carton, coat it with paraffin, fill it with pasteurized milk direct from the cooling chamber, then seal the carton. Visitors to the INLACA plant in Valencia, capital of the state of Carabobo, can watch the milk make this fascinating trip in a matter of minutes and then take a carton home, secure in the sanitation of handling the pasteurized product. Also, the date on which the milk is packaged is stamped on the container. 10. Inside view of the market. 11. A view of the store, the sign is not yet up but will go on the side white wall. 12. The plantain, a staple Venezuelan food, receives special attention in a nutrition display. 13. CIDEA posters advise growing vegetables for health and economy and flowers for enjoyment, in cooperation with an "arbor day" observed in Caracas. 14. A teacher explains to children in a school nutrition club, sponsored by CIDEA, the differences between leafy and root vegetables. 15. A traveling CIDEA instructor explains posters showing the relation of good diet to good health. 16. No caption. 17. No caption. 18. Venezuela was the first South American country to adopt the sanitary, economical packaging of milk in cartons rather than bottles. 19. INLACA milkman makes a delivery to a thatched roof home in Valencia. Many of the districts reached by INLACA formerly had success only with raw milk. 20. The success of the INLACA plant, which recently was enlarged, had caused dairy herds in the neighborhood to increase by more than 50 per cent.</p>

Van Wagner, general manager of VBEC; and Mr. Robert Lowery, superintendent of PACA's Chirgua farm, inspect the farm's corn fields. 122. Laborers follow mechanical potato differ, sacking potatoes, at the Montesacro Farm, Cirgua Valley, where a total harvest of 650,000 pounds is expected. 123. PACA: Chirgua Potato Harvest. Vicente Emilio Carvajal, manager of the CADA temporary warehouse in La Avenida San Martin with some bags of potatoes received from Chirgua. 124. Mechanical double-row potato differ being utilized by PACA in fist potato harvest at Montesacro Farm, Chirgua Valley, unearths 8 acres of potatoes daily and reduces number of workers needed during labor scarce harvesting season. 125. C.O. Gingrass, manager from 1949-1950 of PACA's Montesacro Farm in Chirgua Valley, gives last minute instructions to Venezuelan tractor driver, Dimas Garcia. Garcia, trained in operation of farm machinery by Gingrass, is one of four Venezuelan tractor-bulldozer drivers first employed on PACA farms. He handles one of the 60-ton tractors used in clearing woods, brush, and opening of roads on the farms. 126. Disks prepare 90 acres on Montesacro Farm for a crop of black beans, one of Venezuela's basic foods. 127. 16-ton bulldozer clears the way for a corn field at Chirgua farm. 128. Potato fields at Montesacro, Chirgua Valley, are irrigated with recently-installed portable overhead sprinkler system, utilized during December through April dry season. Water for irrigation is piped from two 200-foot wells drilled by PACA, from mountain springs water trapped in artificial lakes, and the Chirgua River which crosses the property. 129. Rollers cut up dried corn stalks to prepare land for potato crop at Montesacro Farm in Chirgua Valley. 130. C.T. Watson, Asst. Manager of PACA in charge of agronomy, has his curiosity aroused by the results of the test plot of Egyptian wheat grown on the company's Chrigua Farms. One thousand pounds of seed (for future planting) came off the half-acre area. Besides this unusually high production, Watson pointed out, the crop reached maturity in 68 days, three weeks earlier than in the southern US. Egyptian wheat will be used chiefly for poultry feed on Chirgua. Expert Watson comes from Dallas, Texas, and has twenty-one years experience with the US government, first as the County Agricultural Agent in Dawson County, Texas, and later as Texas State Director of the Farm Security Administration. He joined VBEC on its tropical food production venture last year. 131. Chirgua Farm manager, C.O. Gingrass, digs up and shows off the first test crop of Hawaiian peanuts ready for harvest on the PACA farm. The 1/8 acre test plot produced an unusually high quantity of large peanuts, many of which contained four kernels instead of two. Five to ten acres will now be planted in Hawaiian peanuts for use as hog pastures. Gingrass, who comes from Edinburg, Texas, has been working and experimenting in tropical agriculture for over 20 years with the US Dept. of Entomology and Plant Quarantine and later with the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs. "I'm a farming pioneer," says Gingrass, "and Latin American agriculture offers new frontiers to a farmer who is interested in experimentation, modernization of agriculture, and --- hard work." 132. Gingrass looks over an experimental crop of Dwarf Hegari, a grain sorghum to be utilized as feed for the company's poultry and livestock programs. Gingrass has worked in tropical agriculture since 1927 when he entered the US Dept. of Entomology and Plant Quarantine. In 1945 and 1946, he managed the Tocoron Experimental Farm near Maracay, Venezuela, which was operated by the Inter-American Cooperative Food Production Service. 133.

Gingrass gives last minute instructions to Venezuelan tractor driver, Dimas Garcia. Garcia, who was trained in the operation of farm machinery by Gingrass, is one of the four Venezuelan tractor-bulldozer drivers now carrying out deforestation of the two PACA farms in Chirgua. He handles one of the 60-ton tractors now in use on the farms for speed clearance of woods and brush, and the opening of the property's new roads. 135. Food production experts on the PACA farm in Chirgua Valley go into an enthusiastic huddle over new specimens of field seeds recently imported by the company from the US. At left, Gingrass shows a handful of stock pea seeds to Watson, Asst. Manager of PACA in charge of agronomy and Asst. Manager of Chirgua, Dalton Clark, who are seated at the table. Test plots of over seventy varieties of clobber, peas and grain sorghums are now being planted on the farm for experimentation in pastures to graze a Jersey milk herd imported form Texas, and a breeding and meat production herd of crossbreed US and VE cattle. 136. PACA has installed gasoline pumps to utilize water from the Chirgua River for irrigation of 250 acres of potato, corn and vegetable fields at its Montesacro Farm. Fourteen-inch pipes carry water to the portable overhead sprinkler system which irrigates the farm during the five months of dry season beginning in December. 138. Sixteen-ton bulldozer finishes off ten-minute job of felling one more tree on Chirgua Farm. 750 acres have been deforested by PACA on Chirgua, the remaining 87 acres will be cleared during the year to make way for maximum production of field crops. 139. Left to right, Mr. E.G. Van Wagner, General Manager of VBEC; Mr. Robert Lowery, Superintendent of PACA's Chirgua Farm; and Mr. Harlo Von Wald, Manager of PACA, view fields of high corn at Chirgua Farm which yielded some 2,700 kilos of corn per hectare in the fall harvest. 140.

In Catia, one of Caracas' poorer, populous districts, PESCA opened its first modern equipped retail fish store in June, 1948. An approx. 6,000 pounds of fresh fish, ranging in prices from 35 to 75 cents a pound, were sold in Oct. and volume of sales is increasing monthly. The company's second store, opened in July, is located in the eastern section of Caracas. The catch is brought from the VE fishing zone around Margarita Island on the 41-ton run boat, Doba Sara, and transported over the mountains from La Guaira port to the capital in the company's refrigerated trucks. A 10-ton capacity ice box has been installed in the Catia store where the Caracas supply is held on ice under strict sanitary conditions until sold. 24. Two diesel engines furnish Pesquerias Caribe with the power for the ice producing plant, cold storage and light. 25. The multiple services offered at the PESCA pier allow fisherman to finish shore tasks within a few hours and spend more time at sea. 26. PESCA is now completing the construction of a 500-foot long, 20-foot wide pier in Puerto La Cruz where the company's boats will dock to unload their catch. Less than 100 feet from the pier, PESCA is constructing its cold storage and ice manufacturing plant. The Pier is to be reinforced with cement pipes and specially prepared timber which is being imported. 27.

              <p>32. The "Mensajero", owned by old time Island fishermen, Tip Juan (facing camera), enters the port of Los Frailes to take on ice for fishing trip. The launch has converted from a sailboat into a motorized vessel under the PESCA system. During 1948, PESCA equipped 29 such fishing boats with motors and ice boxes on an installment plan. Fishermen sell their catch to the company and equipment is paid for the deducting 20 percent of all fish brought in. It is calculated that fishermen can pay off their boats within ten months. Under this system, fishermen are beginning to double their monthly catch. 33. Blocks of ice from the Puerto La Cruz plant of PESCA are rolled out on the pier for loading onto a fishing boat. Other customers are waiting their turn. 34. PESCA fish on sale in Puerto La Cruz market 35. PESCA has purchased a fleet of five trucks which transport fish under refrigeration into Caracas and other consuming centers. The fleet includes two 5-ton trucks which carry fish on ice; and one 3-ton open truck. 36. Boats owned by PESCA are equipped with radio-telephone which allows them to remain in constant and direct communication with the company office at Porlamar, thus making for greater efficiency and safety on the seas. 37. Fish is hoisted up to dock at port of La Guaira from PESCA's 41 ton runboat which transports the catch from the eastern fishing grounds of VE. 38. Crew of PESCA's 41 ton runboat, Dona Sara, weigh out fish at the port of La Guaira to be transported to Caracas for distribution. 39. Fish is packed on ice on PESCA's runboat to assure complete freshness of catch during the 24hour trip from VE's eastern fishing grounds to Caracas. 40.

Frozen PESCA fish fillets in one-pound packages furnish consumers with a reasonably priced product, available all year round. 45. Many of Caracas' leading supermarkets carry PESCA frozen fish fillets. These one-pound packages help keep a steady supply of fish in the market. 46. PESCA's insulated truck meets incoming fishing boats at the company's pier to pick up the boat's catch to be delivered at the plant. 47. Ice blocks are hauled to the pier on company trucks to furnish fishermen with the necessary means to keep their catch in good condition while fishing. 48. 16,400 sq.ft. cold storage and ice manufacturing plant constructed by PESCA was opened on June 19. The plant has capacity to freeze 6,600 pounds of fish every four hours and manufactures 30 tons of ice daily. 49.

The PESCA pier is the only one open to independent fishermen along the eastern VE coast. 60. Los Frailes Island, near rich fishing grounds, PESCA has constructed an icing station with 9000-ton holding capacity for ice and fish. There independent fishermen working for the company weigh in and receive cash payment for their catch, and load ice for outgoing trips. Thus fishermen are saved the two hour trip from fishing grounds to Margarita Island to sell their fish. Company plans to make available at stations small equipment and food provisions needed by fishermen on runs. PESCA has set up two additional stations, one with 6000-kilo capacity at Porlamar, Margarita, and another at Juan Griego Island with 3000-kilo capacity. A fourth will be constructed at Los Testigos Island, in an effort to cover most important island fishing grounds. 61. PCCA retail store, Carabobo Park. 62. At Puerto Fermin, Margarita Island, PESCA machine shop workers install diesel engine in the 20-ton launch, "Emanuel", independent owned boar which will begin fishing for the company. Including the motor and a 3 ton built in icebox, owner Pedro Marrero's bill with PESCA adds up to Bs 14,000 which he will pay off on the installment plan at the rate of 20 % of his catch. Since such equipment allows fishermen to double and even triple their catch, Pedro calculates his boat will be clear within ten months. In the background, the 22-ton Josefa Raquel, owned by PESCA, is being outfitted with motor and icebox to serve in company fleet as fish/transport boat. 63. Independent fishermen working for the company load ice from company's icing station at Porlamar for boats waiting to leave on next fishing trip. PESCA has already installed ice boxes in 29 independent fishing launches, which enable fishermen to stay longer at fishing grounds and arrive at the shore with completely fresh fish. Ice boxes are paid off under an installment plan of 20% of catch sold to the company. Ice is being furnished free by PCCA. 64. Veteran sailor and fisherman Carl Hansen takes the wheel of the Dona Sara which he will captain for Caribbean Fisheries during its first period of operations. When the 64 year old captain was fourteen, he ran away from his home in Denmark to go to sea. "I'm still an adventurer", he admits. "I never married and I never settled down, and I always like to sight new shore". Hansen now has his own fishing boat in Pensacola, but will lend a hand to VE fishing this year. 65. The Dona Sara will be captained by Maurice Walker from Pensacola. The craft is 65 feet long, weighs 42 tons and has quarters for eight crew members. Radio telephone allows it to keep in constant contact with shore installations. 66. In Catia, one of Caracas' poorer, populous districts, PESCA opened its first modern-equipped retail fish store in June 1948. An approximate 6000 pounds of fresh fish, ranging in price from 35 to 75 cents a pound, were sold in Oct and volume of sales is increasingly monthly. The company's second store, opened in July, is located in the eastern section of Caracas. The catch is brought from the VE fishing zone around Margarita Island on the 41 ton run boat, Dona Sara, and transported over the mountains from La Guaira port to the capital in the company's refrigerated trucks. A 10-ton capacity ice box has been installed in the Catia store where the Caracas supply is held on ice under strict sanitary conditions until sold. 67. The 50 ft Santa Clara is a sample of more fishing boats to come. Its many modern devices such as radio-telephone, sonic depth finder, automatic pilot and radio direction finder make fishing easier, sailing safer and will mean more catch per hour. 68. Construction of PESCA 18,000 sq. ft. cold storage and ice manufacturing plant in Puerto Rico La Cruz (near VE's eastern fishing zone) will be ended in late 12/1948. The plant will produce thirty tons of ice daily, which will be distributed to the company's boats and to independent fishermen through icing stations being set up along the eastern coast. The plant will have a freezing capacity of 3300 pounds of fish every 4 hours; storage capacity of 100 tons of ice; 360 cubic meter cooler at 35degrees F, a 360 cubic meter freezer set at 5 degrees F. Fish production, November, reached 43,000 kilos (94,600 pounds). 69. - 81. No captions.</p>

              <p>90. Cooling tanks for handling 10,000 liters of milk daily were installed on the hacienda "El Capitan" recently by Via Lactea's late partner, Don Deigo Garcia. 91. Close-up of the filtering process which is routine for the 4,000 liters of milk received daily from the Garcia dairy farms in the Perija region of Zulia. This milk in turn is hauled to the Via Lactea plant in Maracaibo. 92. An employee on the hacienda "El Capitan" pours milk through the first four filters (three others are affixed to containers inside the building). "El Capitan" was headquarters for the farming operations of Don Diego Garcia, late Via Lactea partner, who supplied the Maracaibo plant with 4,000 liters of milk daily. 93. Milk obtained from the vast heard of the late Don Diego Garcia, former VBEC Maracaibo partner, is filtered four times before cooling in large steel vats. Through the screened-window can be seen the first vessel into which the milk is poured through a clean, white cloth filter. After passing into the cooling chamber through steel pipes, it is run from the two faucets into sterilized milk cans through first a cloth, then two paper filters. 94. Protected feeding stables were installed by a Via Lactea supplier in the Perija district of Zulia. One of the last plans of the late Don Diego Garcia was to equip his farm with similar roofed sheds. 95. Horses, as well as dairy cattle, are bred on the land of Don Diego Garcia. The photo was taken by Paul Meyn in a pasture of the hacienda "El Capitan", one of the ten large farms Garcia owned in the Perija district of Zulia. 96. A group of calves from the herd of Don Diego Garcia, late Maracaibo partner of the Venezuela Basic Economy Corporation in the Via Lactea milk pasteurizing plant and TODOS commercial center. The photo was taken by Paul Meyn at the Hacienda "El Capitan", one of ten large dairy farms owned by the Zulia capitalist. 97. Farm house and principal outbuildings on the hacienda "El Capitan", property of the late Don Diego Garcia, former VBEC Maracaibo partner. (This scene was used in the composite photo prepared by Paul Meyn for the cover of the Sept. issue of "Campo" which was revised after Garcia's death). 98. Part of the improving herd of the late Don Diego Garcia, former Via Lactea and TODOS partner, at his hacienda "El Capitan" in the state of Zulia. Garcia concentrated on crossing pure-bred Holstein bulls, specially-conditioned for life in the tropics, with the local "criolla" cows. 99. Pastoral scene happily shaped by Paul Meyn at the hacienda "El Capitan", one of ten fine farms owned by the late Don Diego Garcia, former Via Lactea and TODOS partner. 100. A deliveryman for Via Lactea, dairy products company organized by Nelson Rockefeller's VBEC, brings the day's pasteurized milk to Santa Rosa de Agua, a village built on stilts on the shores of Lake Maracaibo, VE. 101.

          <p>Conservationist and leader in the field of historic preservation, Kenneth Chorley was born in Bournemouth, England, on May 21, 1893, the son of Dr. Edward Clowes and Florence (Dover) Chorley. He moved to the United States with his family in 1900. He attended Manlius School in Manlius, New York, and received an honorary LL.D. from the College of William and Mary in 1934. In 1920, he married Elizabeth O'Kane, and they had two children. That marriage ended in divorce in 1941. Chorley married Jean Travers in 1941.</p>
          <p>Prior to 1923, Chorley worked for the El Paso &amp; Southwestern Railroad; the Detroit, Toledo &amp; Ironton Railroad; and the Nevins Church Press. Kenneth Chorley began his long association with John D. Rockefeller, Jr. in 1923 when he became an associate of Arthur Woods in the Office of the Messieurs Rockefeller. In the ensuing years Chorley represented Mr. Rockefeller, Jr. in his numerous interests. Chorley was a staff member of the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial from 1923-1928, and later of the Spelman Fund of New York (1928-1936).</p>
          <p>Chorley was active in the restoration of Colonial Williamsburg from its inception in 1926 and worked closely with John D. Rockefeller, Jr. to recreate eighteenth-century Williamsburg as living history. He served as vice-president (1930-1935), treasurer (1934-1937), president (1935-1958), and director (1930-1963) of Williamsburg Restoration, Inc., and was a board member until his retirement in 1963. He was also trustee (1930-1963), vice-president (1930-1935), treasurer (1934-1937), and succeeded Arthur Woods as president (1935-1958) of Colonial Williamsburg, Inc., which holds title to nearly all the properties in the restored area and operates the exhibition buildings and all educational programs.</p>
          <p>Mr. Chorley also served as Mr. Rockefeller, Jr.'s representative in the creation of Grand Teton National Park. Beginning in 1926, Chorley directed the Snake River Land Company's acquisition and conservation of over 33,000 acres of land in the Grand Tetons. The land was turned over to the National Park Service in 1949 as a part of Grand Teton National Park. Jackson Hole Preserve, Incorporated, which succeeded the Snake River Land Company, administered the land and the preserve. The Grand Teton Lodge Company, which succeeded the Grant Teton Lodge and Transportation Company, was the business corporation that operated visitor accommodations at the park. Both organizations were created in 1940. Chorley served as trustee (1940-1974), treasurer (1952-1955), and vice-president (1954-1964) of Jackson Hole Preserve, Inc., and president (1952-1963) of the Grand Teton Lodge Company.</p>
          <p>Kenneth Chorley died March 21, 1974.</p>

          <p>The Agricultural Development Council, Inc. was founded in 1953 by John D. Rockefeller 3rd as The Council on Economic and Cultural Affairs, Inc. It was incorporated as a private, non-profit organization under the laws of the State of New York.</p>
          <p>In 1963 the name was changed, but the purposes remained unchanged from those stated in the original Certificate of Incorporation. In broad terms the Council's purposes were "charitable, scientific and educational," and were "designed to stimulate and support economic and related activities important to human welfare."</p>
          <p>The Council, from its beginning, committed a major part of its resources and its staff to training and research activities in social science fields. These activities followed both formal and informal patterns. The single aim was to strengthen professional capacity to deal with the economic and human problems of agricultural and rural development in Asia.</p>
          <p>In 1985, the Agricultural Development Council, Inc. merged with two other Rockefeller family - related organizations, the International Agricultural Development Service and the Winrock International Livestock Research and Training Center, to become Winrock International.</p>

          <p>Leonard Outhwaite, 1892-1979, worked as a consultant, an anthropologist, and an author.</p>
          <p>Mr. Outhwaite was a staff member of the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial from 1923 to 1928 where one of his fields of interest was American race relations.</p>
          <p>In the 1930s, Mr. Outhwaite served The Rockefeller Foundation as a consultant in anthropology. In this capacity he studied the development of the field of anthropology in American and foreign universities and produced a report, "Primitive Man in the Modern World." His consultancy with the Foundation also involved studying and preparing a report on the educational programs at art, science, and natural history museums. Following his service at the Foundation, Mr. Outhwaite served as a consultant to various museums and zoos and organized Outhwaite Exhibits, to design and construct museum, commercial, and World's Fair exhibitions.</p>
          <p>Mr. Outhwaite also served the United States government immediately prior to, during, and after World War II. Among his posts were director of resettlement, Farm Security Administration; chief science analyst, Bureau of the Budget; director, Federal Board of Hospitalization. He also worked as a consultant for the Office of Production Management, Natural Resources Planning Board, and served as executive secretary to the Conference on Postwar Adjustment of Civilian and Military Personnel. He prepared a conference report that contributed to the Veterans Bill of Rights.</p>
          <p>In 1948, Mr. Outhwaite, working for Laurance S. Rockefeller, prepared a report on population and population research.</p>
          <p>He also served as research director of Nature Centers, Inc. As a consultant for the Institute of Public Administration, he prepared a study, "Museums and the Future," which was published in 1967.</p>
          <p>Mr. Outhwaite held an interest in anthropology and exploration. In 1929-1930 he covered 14,000 miles of the Atlantic Ocean on an expedition aboard the yacht "Kinkajou," during which he visited Mt. Pele, Martinique.</p>
          <p>Mr. Outhwaite was the author of several books, including "The Atlantic: The History of an Ocean" and "Unrolling the Map." He also prepared an unpublished manuscript, "Life and Times of the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial," an account based on his tenure as a staff member of that organization.</p>

          <p>Wickliffe Rose was born in Saulsbury, Tennessee, on November 19, 1862. He graduated from the University of Nashville in 1889 and received an A.M. degree from the University in 1890.</p>
          <p>His career is divided by two major interests and two main associations. The first interest is that of education. Dr. Rose was instructor in history and mathematics at Peabody College from 1891-1892, and then professor of history and philosophy of education at that college from 1892-1902. In 1902 Dr. Rose moved to the faculty of the University of Tennessee where again he was professor of history and philosophy of education. From 1904-1907 he was Dean of Peabody College and the University of Nashville. In 1908 Dr. Rose left academic life, and he joined the Peabody Education Fund as General Agent in 1910. He also served as Executive Secretary for the Southern Education Board during 1909-1910.</p>
          <p>Dr. Rose's second major interest was public health and, more specifically, public health education. In 1910 he turned down a position as President at Peabody College to become Executive Secretary of the Rockefeller Sanitary Commission until its termination in 1915. With the end of the Commission, Dr. Rose joined the International Health Division of the Rockefeller Foundation and extended the work of the Sanitary Commission to foreign countries, conducted a campaign against yellow fever, and promoted public health at home and abroad.</p>
          <p>Resigning the Directorship of the International Health Division in 1923, Dr. Rose assumed the Presidency of the General Education Board and the International Education Board where he remained until his retirement in 1928.</p>
          <p>Wickliffe Rose died on September 5, 1931, while on a fishing trip in British Columbia.</p>

          <p>Joseph Henry Willits was born on June 16, 1889, in Ward, Pennsylvania. His family traced itself back to early Quaker settlers; as a sign of his heritage, Willits himself often used the "plain speech" in correspondence with his co-religionists and older relatives.</p>
          <p>Willits received his A.B. in 1911 and his A.M. in 1912 from Swarthmore College. In the latter year he was appointed Instructor of Geography and Industrial Economics at the Wharton School of Finance and Economics of the University of Pennsylvania. He received his Ph.D. in Economics from that university in 1916. During World War I, Willits served as an employment supervisor of the U.S. Naval Aircraft Factory in Philadelphia. After the war he returned to the University of Pennsylvania; in 1921 he was promoted to Director of the Department of Industrial Economics at the Wharton School, later becoming Dean of the School (1933-1939).</p>
          <p>During this period, Dr. Willits served on a number of Federal advisory boards and was active as a copious writer and speaker on labor problems. In 1928 he delivered the Wertheim Lectures at Harvard. He was elected President of the National Bureau of Economic Research in 1933 and Executive Director from 1936 to 1939. He retained ties with this organization until 1968.</p>
          <p>From January 1, 1939, until his retirement on June 30, 1954, Dr. Willits was Director of the Division of Social Sciences of The Rockefeller Foundation.</p>
          <p>After his retirement from the Foundation, Dr. Willits was named Director of The Educational Survey of the University of Pennsylvania. Under his direction and coordination, every major facet of university life came under review. This massive project was completed between 1954-1959. Dr. Willits conducted a similar study of the Winterthur Museum in 1961.</p>
          <p>Partially financed by the Carnegie Corporation, Dr. Willits worked on a general study of "Excellence and Mediocrity in Colleges and Universities" which was one of his principal activities during the 1960s. Although the completed manuscript and its several revisions were submitted to publishers, this work never appeared in print.</p>

          <p>Incorporated on September 17, 1963, with the stated purpose "to stimulate, encourage, promote, and support activities important to human welfare," the JDR 3rd Fund was conceived as the vehicle by which John D. Rockefeller 3rd could address his varied interests in fields not served by such organizations as The Population Council or The Asia Society. Mr. Rockefeller acted as President of the Fund from its establishment until his death on July 10, 1978.</p>
          <p>Under its broad charter, the Fund engaged in three major programs: The Asian Cultural Program, The Arts in Education Program, and the Youth Task Force.</p>
          <p>From 1963 until 1967, the Asian Cultural Program was the only activity of the Fund. Under the leadership of Datus C. Smith, Jr. and Porter A. McCray, this program operated throughout the Asian continent from Japan through Afghanistan. It promoted East-West cultural understanding through three main types of activity. Individual scholars and performing artists attempting exchanges between the two traditions received fellowships. Institutional grants were also given to aid in preserving native Asian cultural traditions through such activities as archaeological expeditions, library support, preservation of art work, and publications. The Program also sponsored tours by performing artists and exhibitions of art work in order to increase cross-cultural appreciation among the general public. Upon the dissolution of the Fund in 1979, these activities were continued by a new corporation, The Asian Cultural Council.</p>
          <p>The Arts in Education Program was established in September 1967 in response to the 1965 Rockefeller Panel Report on the Performing Arts. In the words of Mr. Rockefeller, "The Fund's objectives in establishing the Arts in Education Program is to make the arts an integral part of our educational system at all grade levels." Directed by Kathryn Bloom and her associates Richard Grove, Jack Morrison, Gene C. Wenner, and Jane Remer, the Program operated on three levels. Pilot projects, such as those at University City, Missouri, and Mineola, New York, were established in receptive school systems to provide models which could be widely adapted elsewhere. Particular attention was placed on designing curriculum tools to integrate the arts into all phases of classroom learning, mostly through the research of CEMREL (Central Midwestern Regional Educational Laboratory). Finally, pooling of ideas and talents was encouraged through consortia such as the League of Cities for the Arts in Education and the Ad Hoc Coalition of States, both of which received financial support and leadership through the Fund. These activities continued until July 1979.</p>
          <p>The Youth Task Force was created by the Fund in October 1970. It was designed to promote collaborative efforts between the youth of the 1970s and establishment leaders in business and the professions. Under the direction of Jerry J. Swift, the Task Force sponsored a series of dialogues between groups of young adults and older figures, held in Minneapolis, Minnesota; Cleveland, Ohio; Jackson, Mississippi; and San Francisco, California. When these meetings demonstrated a basis for cooperation, the Task Force sought to provide technical assistance for activities in which both elements could join, such as environmental and health service programs. Between 1970 and 1974, the Task Force also sponsored a series of surveys of youth attitudes which were conducted by Daniel Yankelovich, Inc. and resulted in a number of publications. The Youth Task Force was disbanded in July 1974.</p>
          <p>The Fund also undertook a number of short-term projects not covered by the three main programs. Chief of these was the Bicentennial Project, an effort to coordinate the participation of the private sector in this national celebration by relating it to contemporary problems. Other interests of the Fund included the teaching of English in Japan, domestic volunteer service in Indonesia, and studying the impact of private philanthropy on American life.</p>
          <p>Upon the death of Mr. Rockefeller in 1978, leadership of the Fund passed to his wife, Mrs. Blanchette Rockefeller. Under her direction, the Fund fulfilled its obligations for the ensuing fiscal year and was dissolved in July 1979.</p>

          <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
          <p>The American Council for the Arts in Education (hereafter ACAE) was incorporated as a non-profit organization under the laws of the State of Ohio on January 31, 1972. It was the successor organization to the National Council for the Arts in Education (hereafter NCAIE), which had been founded in 1958. Neither the ACAE nor its parent organization were grant-making institutions; both organizations were primarily engaged in study activities intended to promote the arts as an integral part of the general school curriculum.</p>
          <p>At its inception, the ACAE inherited the Arts/Worth Program from the NCAIE. This program received its impetus from the August 1969 Wingspread Conference and was designed "to alter American opinion about the place of the arts in the educational process." Under the direction of Alan Sapp and Joseph C. Sloane, the Arts/Worth Program engaged in a number of promotional and survey activities until financial pressures brought about its demise in 1974.</p>
          <p>In 1974, Norris Houghton became president of the ACAE. Under his leadership, the organization tapped new sources of funding and designed its last major project: the Arts, Education and Americans Panel. The Panel was headed by David Rockefeller, Jr., and consisted of leading figures in the fields of government, the performing arts, business, and education. Its principal function was to determine the status of the arts in American education through intensive surveys and research, thereby formulating comprehensive proposals for the integration of the arts with all aspects of school curricula. The panel issued its final report, entitled "Coming to Our Senses," in May 1977.</p>
          <p>Upon the release of this report, Arts, Education and Americans, Inc. was incorporated on May 24, 1977, as a separate non-profit corporation to carry on the work started by the Panel.</p>

            <p>The West Africa Program of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, launched late in 1957, was designed to provide technical assistance tailored to the economic development needs of Ghana and Nigeria. While the Fund's original resolve to aid Liberia in the same manner proved unfruitful, the Republic of Togo also became a beneficiary of this program in a minor way.</p>
            <p>Under the limits established by the Fund, the West Africa Program did not operate as a grant-making agency. At the request of ministries in one of the African governments involved or of a private group of investors and industrialists, the Fund contracted with outside consultants to prepare "feasibility studies." Each of these studies dealt in depth with a specific aspect of the concerned nation's economic potential or needs and was designed to provide a realistic framework for later action. The Fund's responsibility ended with the submission of these studies to the appropriate agencies or private groups.</p>
            <p>The Program's main office in Lagos, Nigeria was also a distribution point for these studies. Its director, Robert I. Fleming, acted as a liaison between the governments of Togo, Ghana, and Nigeria and groups of U.S. investors. The Lagos office organized investigative tours for these investors and arranged their contacts with governmental personnel.</p>
            <p>The West Africa Program of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund was concluded at the end of 1962.</p>

          <p>The Union Tank Car Company (hereafter UTCC) originated in the Star Tank Line founded in 1866 by J. J. Vandergrift. Vandergrift, one of the early competitors of the Standard Oil Company, organized this Line to handle oil freight between the Pennsylvania oil fields and Chicago. After Vandergrift's holdings were sold to Standard Oil in 1873, the Star Tank Line became that company's carrier. The name was changed to Union Tank Car Company in 1878.</p>
          <p>As part of the reorganization of the Standard Oil Trust in 1890-1891, the Union Tank Line was incorporated under the laws of the state of New Jersey on August 1, 1891. Standard Oil of New Jersey was its holding company. The Union Tank Line remained exclusively a carrier of Standard Oil products until the dissolution of the Trust in 1911.</p>
          <p>Greater diversification of customers and services developed during the 1920s and 1930s. This was signaled as well by the change of name to UTCC and the relocation of the company's offices to Chicago in 1927. After 1931, the UTCC branched into chemical hauling and tank car manufacturing. In 1957, the UTCC acquired the Graver and Phoenix Manufacturing Companies, the first in a series of corporate mergers which was to make the UTCC one of the largest tank carrier companies in the world. In 1969, the UTCC created a holding company, Trans Union Corporation, and the latter company, together with its subsidiaries (including UTCC), was acquired in 1981 by The Marmon Group, owned by the Pritzler Family of Chicago.</p>
          <p>Presidents of the Union Tank Line/Tank Car Company during this period were as follows: Wesley H. Tilford (1891-1905); Henry E. Felton (1905-1919); William A. Barstow (1919-1922); E. C. Sicardi (1923-1926); Lauren J. Drake (1927-1947); B. Clifford Graves (1947-1955); Edwin A. Locke, Jr. (1955-1962); Jerome W. Van Gorkom (1962-1975).</p>

          <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
          <p>Harold Pegram Fabian was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, on April 1, 1885. Mr. Fabian attended public schools in Salt Lake City and the Mercersburg (PA) Academy, received an A.B. from Yale in 1907 and an LL.B. from Harvard University in 1910. He returned to Salt Lake City and began practicing law in the firm of Dey, Hoppaugh and Fabian. He remained in Utah throughout his life and eventually became the senior partner in the firm of Fabian and Clendenin of Salt Lake City.</p>
          <p>Through his partner, Beverly Clendenin, Fabian met Horace Albright, the Superintendent of Yellowstone National Park, around 1920 and formed a fast friendship. At the same time a group of Jackson Hole residents were making plans to preserve the Teton Mountains from unrestricted development and had recruited Albright to their cause. Albright, in turn, impressed John D. Rockefeller, Jr. with the vision of their plans while Mr. Rockefeller was on a tour of the West in 1926. Superintendent Albright took Mr. Rockefeller to view the Teton Mountains and Jackson's Hole, and Mr. Rockefeller very quickly began to organize a preservation plan. The firm of Fabian and Clendenin was contacted to act as counsel, and Fabian became the Western representative of Mr. Rockefeller and the person responsible for organizing and operating the Snake River Land Company. The Snake River Land Company was incorporated in 1927. It was formed to acquire property for eventual inclusion in the Grand Teton National Park. Fabian was not at first aware of the program's sponsor but probably knew by 1929, by which time the purchasing program was earnestly underway.</p>
          <p>One of the immediate problems to arise was the continued operation of a tourist lodge and cabins at Moran, Wyoming. About 70,000 tourists per year went through Jackson Hole at the time, and tourism was an important facet of the local economy. The response was to organize the Teton Companies in 1930. Their purpose was to provide lodging and transportation for tourists in cooperation with the Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks.</p>
          <p>This activity did not go unchallenged. Some local residents, especially cattle ranchers, resented what they considered to be a "takeover" by wealthy Easterners and a tyranny by the National Park Service. This disgruntlement led to several investigations. One of the most critical for the fledgling organization was conducted in 1930 by the Senate Special Committee on Wild Life Resources which examined the Land Company records, surveyed the country, and held hearings in Jackson Hole. The Committee returned a favorable report, finding no wrongdoing or scandalous machinations by Mr. Rockefeller, Jr. or the Snake River Land Company. Later investigations reported similar findings.</p>
          <p>By 1933 the Snake River Land Company had acquired over 32,000 acres which fulfilled the majority of its purchasing program. With purchases mostly complete, the Company concentrated on management. It had acquired several ranches that were used to produce hay for the elk refuge, wildlife park and local market. It required a great deal of effort to refurbish, maintain and operate these ranches. There were encroachment problems and leases to negotiate and a good deal of intercourse between the Company and the Jackson Hole community to handle. Richard Winger filled a central role in fulfilling these functions. Overshadowing these daily affairs was a decade-long dispute with the Utah-Idaho Sugar Company over water rights in several lakes in the Jackson Hole area.</p>
          <p>The Teton Companies were also very active throughout the 1930s. The Teton Investment Company was organized in 1930 and in turn organized the Teton Lodge Company and the Teton Transportation Company. The Lodge Company consisted of the Teton Lodge at Moran and the Jackson Lake Lodge on Jackson Lake. The Transportation Company provided the over-the-mountain connection between Jackson Hole, the Union Pacific Railroad, and Yellowstone National Park. In 1936 a reorganization merged the separate entities into the Grand Teton Lodge and Transportation Company, and in 1956 another reorganization let to the creation of the Grand Teton Lodge Company. The corporate changes reflected the growth of tourism and the need for facilities to accommodate that growth.</p>
          <p>Jackson Hole Preserve, Inc. was also formed to accommodate changing conditions. In 1940 the Land Company transferred its holdings to what shortly became the Jackson Hole National Monument. The new organization was formed to carry on the role of preservation. Property supervision continued, but increasingly more effort was directed toward enhancing the quality of the preserved area.</p>
          <p>The restoration of Menor's Ferry was the first such effort. Fabian and his wife Josephine were deeply involved in this project to reconstruct the ferry and ranch buildings. Beyond the physical reconstruction they especially wanted to remember the pioneers of the area and their history. A wildlife park, constructed in 1946, was another effort to preserve the original beauty of Jackson Hole.</p>
          <p>Concomitantly, Jackson Hole Preserve, Inc. broadened its role by participating in conservation efforts throughout the United States. This was a result both of Laurance S. Rockefeller's energetic leadership and the general understanding that conservation is a national issue.</p>
          <p>Harold Fabian retired from active business in 1954, but he never relinquished either his interest in Jackson Hole or his concern for conservation issues. He continued an active career working for conservation and historic preservation on both the national and state levels. He remained a Trustee of Jackson Hole Preserve, Inc. until his death in 1975.</p>

          <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
          <p>The China Medical Board, Inc. traces its origin to the unincorporated China Medical Board, which was created in 1914 as a division of the Rockefeller Foundation to care for the developing interests of the foundation in China (see Rockefeller Foundation Archives, Record Group 4). In 1915, the Rockefeller Foundation purchased and assumed support of the Union Medical College in Peking, which had been founded in 1906 by a group of Protestant missionaries. The institution was renamed the Peking Union Medical College (at times referred to as the Peiping Union Medical College). Its reconstruction, development and support gradually became the primary, though not the exclusive, interest of the China Medical Board. At formal dedication ceremonies held in Peking in 1921, the objectives of the Peking Union Medical College (PUMC) were set forth in a speech delivered by John D. Rockefeller, Jr. These can be summarized as follows:</p>
          <p> 1. To develop in China a medical school and hospital comparable with that of the leading institutions of Western civilization and to offer thorough training in scientific medicine.</p>
          <p>2. To stimulate the creation of similar institutions in various parts of China.</p>
          <p>3. To provide graduate instruction in the form of short courses in subjects for which the need is great.</p>
          <p>4. To prosecute research, for the influence it may exert upon standards and methods of medical education, the training of teachers and leaders, and the solution of problems of disease in China.</p>
          <p>5. To permeate the work of the institution with the finest idealism and to interpret to China the best of the West, not only in medical science but in mental development and spiritual culture.</p>
          <p>6. To make permanent on Chinese soil the best in scientific medicine that the world can offer, with the realization that what it may have to offer will be of little avail to the Chinese people until it is taken over by them and becomes a part of the national life. Toward this end, to create in the future a faculty of whom most, if not all, are Chinese and a Board of Trustees similarly constituted.</p>
          <p>In 1928, the China Medical Board was incorporated under the Membership Corporations Law of the State of New York. Its certificate of incorporation provided that "the purposes of which it is formed are exclusively charitable, educational and scientific and are to extend financial support to the Peking Union Medical College and/or like institutions in the Far East or in the United States of America." The Rockefeller Foundation transferred to the new organization the ownership of the land and buildings occupied by the Peking Union Medical College and endowed it with the sum of $12,000,000, agreeing to provide, from time to time, additional grants toward the college budget. Until the outbreak of the war with Japan in 1941, the CMB, Inc. devoted its entire income to the support of the College.</p>
          <p>While the Peking Union Medical College (PUMC) was occupied by the Japanese, the CMB, Inc. carried on a program of aid to medical institutions in unoccupied China. At the same time, it assisted undergraduate students of the College to continue their studies elsewhere and helped maintain the College nursing school in Chengtu.</p>
          <p>The Peking Union Medical College (PUMC) was recovered from the Japanese at the close of the war, but was then used as the Executive Headquarters of General Marshall's Peace Commission until April 1947. At this time the CMB, Inc. resumed its annual grant to the Peking Union Medical College (PUMC). By May 1948, the medical school, nursing school and the hospital were once again in operation, though not at the same level as before the war. In January 1951 the Peking Union Medical College was nationalized by the People's Republic of China.</p>
          <p>Since funds could no longer be sent to the Peking Union Medical College (PUMC) or to the mainland, the China Medical Board, Inc. embarked on a new program and enlarged its field within the geographical limits permitted by its charter. Under this program, the CMB, Inc. provides assistance to medical, public health and nursing schools in many Far Eastern countries, and to a lesser degree, to medical, public health and nursing schools in the United States.</p>

          <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
          <p>Physician, medical administrator, author, and president of The Rockefeller Foundation. John Hilton Knowles was born May 23, 1926, in Chicago, Illinois, the son of James and Jean Trumbull Knowles. Dr. Knowles received his A.B. from Harvard College (1947) and his M.D. from Washington University School of Medicine (1951). On June 13, 1953, he married Edith M. LaCroix; they had six children.</p>
          <p>Dr. Knowles began his medical career in 1951 when he was appointed intern at Massachusetts General Hospital. From 1953-1955 he served as Officer-in-Charge of the Cardiopulmonary Laboratory at Portsmouth Naval Hospital in Portsmouth, Virginia. He returned to Massachusetts General Hospital as a resident, specializing in diseases of the heart and lungs, leaving a year later to do postdoctoral work with the United States Public Health Service at the Universities of Rochester and Buffalo. In 1958 he became Chief Resident in Internal Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital. The following year he was named Chief of the Pulmonary Disease Unit.</p>
          <p>In 1962, Dr. Knowles was appointed General Director of Massachusetts General Hospital, the youngest director in the hospital's history. During the next ten years he upgraded working conditions and wages of the hospital staff, established a medical station at Logan International Airport that was connected to the hospital via television, approved the creation of nine intensive-care units including one for the diagnosis and care of cancer patients, and won better rates for hospitals from Blue Cross. He developed a strong interest in social issues of medicine and supported comprehensive federal health insurance and advocated preventive medicine. He was one of a team of doctors sent to Vietnam by President Johnson in 1967 to review and make recommendations concerning the health of the civilian population. In 1969 President Nixon nominated him for the post of Assistant Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare. The nomination was withdrawn six months later because of violent conservative opposition led by Senator Everett Dirkson and the American Medical Association. Prior to leaving Massachusetts General Hospital, Dr. Knowles was censured by the Massachusetts Medical Society for writing an article asserting that many physicians charged exorbitant fees and performed unnecessary operations.</p>
          <p>Dr. Knowles left Massachusetts General Hospital in December 1971 and assumed the presidency of The Rockefeller Foundation in July 1972. Among his activities as Foundation president, he established an international relations program to focus on common global problems and set up the Foundation's publishing division to distribute reports on various Foundation-funded conferences. Dr. Knowles also remained active in the field of medicine; New York University Medical Center appointed him professor of medicine. He was a member of Nelson A. Rockefeller's Commission for Critical Choices (1974), editing the commission's final report "Doing Better and Feeling Worse." In 1975 he visited China with the National Committee on United States-China Relations, Inc., a group of "key United States leaders of world affairs," for a first-hand experience of China.</p>
          <p>Dr. Knowles died of cancer on March 6, 1979.</p>

          <p>An architect, Conrad W. Anner was born in Berlin, Germany, on December 20, 1889, the son of Edmund C. Anner.  Conrad Anner graduated from the Division of Architecture of the Gewerbe Akademie, Chemnitz, Saxony, in 1909 and emigrated to the United States the same year.  He married Caroline H. Foster in 1915; they had two children.</p>
          <p>Anner was first employed as a draughtsman by the Boston architectural firm Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge (1910-1917) and then by the Boston architect Thomas M. James (1917-1919). In 1919 he was hired by The Rockefeller Foundation as architectural draughtsman during the construction of Peking Union Medical College. Anner remained at PUMC until 1930 as supervisor of architectural work.</p>
          <p>Before returning to the United States, he was employed by St. Luke's International Hospital (Tokyo, Japan) to revise the plans of the hospital, and by the Chinese Government to design the National Institute for Physical Research in Shanghai and the National Meteorological Institute in Nanking.</p>
          <p>Following his return to the United States in 1931, Anner worked for the architectural firm Perry, Shaw &amp; Hepburn as Superintendent of Construction at Colonial Williamsburg.</p>
          <p>Conrad W. Anner died in 1960.</p>

          <p>Claude H. Barlow (1876-1969) was born in Lyons, Michigan. In his youth he learned a variety of crafts and arts, including metal working, woodworking, and painting, which he later used in scientific research and illustration.</p>
          <p>Dr. Barlow attended the University of Michigan from 1899 to 1902 and received an M.D. degree from Northwestern in 1906.</p>
          <p>Joining the American Baptist Foreign Mission Society in 1908, Dr. Barlow began twenty years of service as a medical missionary in China. He was Customs Medical Officer for the Chinese Maritime Customs in Ningpo, for which his fees went to the hospital; he was also a surgeon and hospital superintendent in Shaosing. Dr. Barlow received a China Medical Board fellowship to study the human intestinal fluke, which led to a Sc.D. from Johns Hopkins in 1929.</p>
          <p>In 1929, Dr. Barlow joined the staff of the International Health Division and was sent to Egypt where he conducted hookworm and schistosomiasis campaigns and did basic snail research. In 1944 he infected himself with schistosomiasis in order to bring viable eggs to Johns Hopkins for study.</p>
          <p>With the outbreak of World War II, the foundation terminated its Egyptian program and Dr. Barlow joined the Egyptian Ministry of Health, where he remained until his retirement in 1951. In 1951, he conducted a snail survey for South Africa and then returned to the United States.</p>

          <p>The General Education Board (GEB) was established in 1903 by John D. Rockefeller to aid education in the U.S. "without distinction of race, sex or creed." The program included grants for endowment and general budgetary support of colleges and universities, support for special programs, fellowship and scholarship assistance to state school systems at all levels, and development of social and economic resources as a route to improved educational systems. Major colleges and universities across the U.S., as well as many small institutions in every state, received aid from the Board. The emphasis, however, was on the South and the education of Blacks. Offices were established in Richmond, Virginia, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to give GEB agents closer contact with southern communities. The Board was especially active in promoting the public school movement in the early part of the twentieth century. After 1940, programs other than those for southern education were brought to a close; funds were nearly exhausted by the 1950s, and the last appropriation was made in 1964.</p>

          <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
          <p>John C. Bugher (1901-1970) was born in Upland, Indiana. He received his B.S. degree from Taylor University in Upland in 1921. From the University of Michigan he received the following degrees: in 1921, an A.B.; in 1929, an M.D.; and in 1931, an M.S. From 1919-1920, Dr. Bugher served as Instructor in Mathematics and Physics at Taylor University; from March 1926-1928, he was Director of Public Health at South Haven, Michigan; and from 1922 until 1937 he was on the faculty of the University of Michigan, first as Assistant in Bacteriology from 1922-1926, then as Senior Instructor in Pathology from 1929-1932, and finally as Assistant Professor of Pathology from 1933 to 1937, when he resigned to join the Rockefeller Foundation.</p>
          <p>His first two months with the Foundation, from October to December 1937, Dr. Bugher spent in the Foundation's Yellow Fever Laboratories in New York City, becoming familiar with current yellow fever research and techniques prior to an assignment to Colombia, South America. At the end of December he left for Colombia to participate in the laboratory and field investigations in yellow fever being carried on there. During his last three years in Columbia (1940-1943), he served as Director of the Seccion de Estudios Especiales. From October 1943 until October 1948, Dr. Bugher's headquarters were in Lagos, Nigeria, West Africa, where he established the Yellow Fever Institute and served as its Director. Here research in yellow fever, including jungle yellow fever, was carried on, involving not only laboratory studies, but field operations in the forest and other areas of that part of Africa. Upon Dr. Bugher's return to the United States, he was again assigned to the Foundation's laboratories, where his particular responsibilities were the biophysical studies of viruses from January 1949 until March 1951.</p>
          <p>He was then granted a leave of absence by the Foundation to become Deputy Director of the Division of Biology and Medicine of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission from 1951-1952, and then Director from 1952 until 1955. In April 1955, Dr. Bugher returned to active duty with the Rockefeller Foundation and was Director for Medical Education and Public Health from then until April 1959, when he was appointed Consultant on Nuclear Energy Affairs. From April to the end of September 1955, the effective date of Dr. Bugher's resignation from the Atomic Energy Commission, he carried dual Foundation and AEC responsibilities.</p>
          <p>While with the Atomic Energy Commission, Dr. Bugher participated in the testing of various fission and thermonuclear devices, leading to improved weapons; and was in close touch with research activities in the biological sciences and closely associated with and responsible for many of the developments connected with the peaceful uses of atomic energy in the medical field. In the summer of 1955, Dr. Bugher went to Geneva, Switzerland, as an official adviser to the United States Delegation to the First International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy. He also attended the Second International Conference in Geneva, in September 1958.</p>
          <p>Dr. Bugher was a member of various committees in the field of atomic energy, including the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission's Advisory Committee for Biology and Medicine, of which he was appointed Vice Chairman in January 1959 and Chairman in June 1960; the Committee on Atomic Bomb Casualties and the Committee on Pathological Effects of Atomic Radiation of the National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council; the National Committee on Radiation Protection and Measurements; the By-Laws and Rules Committee and the Nominating Committee of American Nuclear Society, of which he was also a member of the Board of Directors; the American Public Health Association Program Area Committee on Radiological Health; Brookhaven National Laboratory (Associated Universities, Inc.) Medical Department Visiting Committee - elected Chairman in May,1960; Committee on New Frontiers of Technology of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce; Health Physics Advisory Board; Mayor's (New York City) Technical Advisory Committee on Radiation, of which he was Chairman; New York State's General Advisory Committee on Atomic Energy; University of Michigan Law School Atomic Energy Advisory Committee; the World Health Organization Panel on Radiation, and the Puerto Rico Nuclear Center Medical Advisory Committee.</p>
          <p>Dr. Bugher was also a member of the National Institute for Disaster Mobilization, Inc., and the New York City Health Research Advisory Council.</p>
          <p>His membership in scientific societies included the Academy of Political Science; Federation of American Societies for Experimental Pathology and Experimental Biology; American Association of Pathologists and Bacteriologists; the Michigan Pathological Society; the American Cancer Society; the American Association of Cancer Research; the American Medical Association; the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene; the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine; the Royal Geographical Society; the American Public Health Association; the Health Physics Society; the American Nuclear Society; the Radiation Research Society; the New York Academy of Sciences, the honorary societies of Alpha Omega Alpha and Sigma Xi. At the University of Michigan, he was a member of the Gamma Alpha Sigma and Phi Rho Sigma fraternities.</p>
          <p>During Dr. Bugher's services with the Foundation and the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, he received various honors, including the award from the President of Colombia in 1943 of the Cruz de Boyaca, and life and honorary membership in the Academy of Medicine of Bogota, Colombia; the bestowal on him in 1948 of the Commander of the Order of the British Empire; the honorary degree of Sc.D. from Taylor University in 1953; the presentation on September 20, 1955, by Chairman Lewis Strauss of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission's Distinguished Service Award and Superior Accomplishment Award; the receipt on May 9, 1956, of the Howard Taylor Ricketts' Award at the University of Chicago, and the Alumnus of the Y ear Award for 1956, from Taylor University on June 1, 1956. In December 1958, Dr. Bugher was made an Honorary Member of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Chile in Santiago. He was unanimously elected a Fellow of The New York Academy of Sciences on December 3, 1959, in "outstanding recognition for scientific achievement and promotion of Science."</p>

          <p>Mark Manderville Jones was born in Cedar Falls, Iowa, in 1890. He started out as an assistant traffic manager, and then manager, for the Waterloo, Cedar Falls and Northern Railway Company. His next job was with the William Galloway Co., also as a traffic manager. He then moved to California, securing a position with the Oakland Chamber of Commerce as Industrial Secretary. In 1916 he married May Irene Rinehart of Akron, Ohio.</p>
          <p>Between 1916 and 1921, Jones was Director of Personnel for Thomas A. Edison Industries. When World War I intervened, he served as Director of the Division of Trade Tests for the Committee on Classification of Personnel in the Army.</p>
          <p>In 1921, Jones joined the industrial relations firm of Curtis, Fosdick and Belknap as Director of Economic Staff. It was here that he became involved in studies, by the firm, of various economic interests of John D. Rockefeller, Jr. He continued to do occasional work for the Rockefellers after he went into private practice as a consulting economist in 1926.</p>
          <p>In addition to Jones' work in economics, public relations, personnel management, and industrial management, he was also President of the Akron Belting Company, 1934 to 1954, and editor of the Executive's Policy Letter, 1948 to 1954. From 1963 to 1969 he was President of the National Economic Council.</p>

          <p>The Russell Sage Foundation was established in 1907 by Margaret Olivia Slocum Sage (1828-1918) as a memorial to her late husband, Russell Sage, the railroad magnate and Wall Street financier. Mrs. Sage's original gift for the Foundation of $10 million was increased in 1918 with a bequest of $5 million.</p>
          <p>The mission of the Russell Sage Foundation is the "improvement of social and living conditions in the United States of America." Mrs. Sage placed no restrictions on how this mission was to be fulfilled. She wished the scope of the Russell Sage Foundation to be national, but also requested that special attention be paid to New York City and its environs.</p>
          <p>The Russell Sage Foundation received the largest single gift made by Mrs. Sage but she dispensed a total of $35 million between 1907 and her death in 1918. She made most of her contributions in the traditional manner of responding to individual solicitations on a case-by-case basis. Some institutions received a single large gift while others received, for several years, regular gifts of lesser amounts. Mrs. Sage also expressed her support of many organizations, mostly local, in a more symbolic way through gifts of $100 or less, lifetime memberships, or annual patronages.</p>
          <p>Between 1907 and 1946, the Russell Sage Foundation focused its attention on improving the quality of living by exposing social problems and proposing and sponsoring practical solutions for those problems. The results of its investigations and field studies were presented in books, pamphlets and articles published by the Russell Sage Foundation.</p>
          <p>During this time the Foundation was organized by departments based on fields of research. Included among these departments were Charity Organization, Industrial Studies, Recreation, Surveys and Exhibits, and Statistics. The areas of study included, but were not limited to, public welfare, labor and industrial relations, regional planning, penology, child welfare, and the social work profession. The Russell Sage Foundation also supported existing social agencies and helped establish new agencies to serve previously neglected social concerns.</p>
          <p>In 1948, due to declining financial investments and the gradual attrition of its staff, the Russell Sage Foundation underwent a philosophical and structural reorganization. It shifted its focus to basic research in the social and behavioral sciences and the strengthening of social welfare methodology. Structurally, it discontinued its specialized departments and created a coordinated central staff of professional personnel. Much of the work could then be carried out by individuals hired temporarily for specific projects. The Russell Sage Foundation presently continues in this role.</p>

          <p>John Stremlau (b. 1944) graduated from Wesleyan University (B.A. 1966) and the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy (M.A. 1967, M.A.L.D. 1968, Ph.D. 1974).</p>
          <p>He joined the Rockefeller Foundation in 1974 to help establish the Conflict in International Relations Program, in which he continued to be active until its termination in 1987. Dr. Stremlau was a Program Associate (1974-1975) and Assistant Director (1976-1976) of the Social Science Program, and Assistant Director (1976-1979), Associate Director (1979-1983), and Acting Director (1984-1987) of the International Relations Program of the Rockefeller Foundation.</p>
          <p>The program supported relevant research and training on an international scale in the areas of international security and economic relations. Activities included aid in the development of new international relations research and training institutions in China, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Latin America, and Africa.</p>
          <p>Dr. Stremlau left the Rockefeller Foundation in 1987 to work with the Rockefeller Family and Associates, in cooperation with Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government, as the Director of the Pocantico Project, intended to create an institute for science and technology in international affairs. Action on the project was deferred in 1988, and Dr. Stremlau then worked with the World Bank, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the Pew Charitable Trusts, the Kettering Foundation, and Rhodes University. In 1989, Dr. Stremlau became a Deputy Director of Policy Planning with the U. S. State Department, serving until 1994, when he became a senior advisor to the Carnegie Commission on Preventing Deady Conflict.  From 1998 to 2006 he taught international relations at the University of Witwatersrand, Johannesburg.  He became vice president for peace programs at the Carter Center in 2006.</p>

          <p>John Marshall (1903-1980) was born in Portland, Maine, completed undergraduate (1925) and graduate (1928) studies, and taught in the English department (1927-1933) at Harvard University. In 1933 he joined the Rockefeller Foundation as Assistant (later Associate) Director of the newly formed Humanities program, and from 1933 to 1940 served as a Director of Education with the General Education Board.</p>
          <p>As an officer with the Rockefeller Foundation in a newly formed program, Mr. Marshall explored not only specific projects, but the concept of the humanities as a field. Mr. Marshall developed a concern in promoting world-wide culture, with a special interest in the Near East. The Rockefeller Foundation funding for the arts and humanities from 1933 to 1950 was approximately $4 million. Between 1951 and 1960, the support increased to $8.4 million, supporting projects in areas including language, radio, and motion pictures.</p>
          <p>Mr. Marshall remained an Associate Director for the Humanities program when appointed as the first director for the newly acquired Villa Serbelloni in Bellagio, Italy, in 1959. The Villa was (and continues to be) used as a retreat for scholars in a variety of disciplines who were were working on intensive projects and as a conference center for international meetings focused on significant issues or scientific develoments.  As director, Marshall worked to develop the direction for the Villa, while maintaining his connections with the European humanities community.</p>
          <p>John Marshall was married to Mary Gardner Marshall (1927-1960) and Charlotte Trowbridge Koechl Marshall (1961), and had two children from his first marriage, Mary Elizabeth Scott and Ann (Sister Mary John OSB). He was the author of "Classic Cooking" (1959).</p>
          <p>Mr. Marshall retired from the Foundation in 1970 and died in 1980.</p>

          <p>John Markle was born in Hazelton, Pennsylvania, in 1858. He graduated from Lafayette College in 1880 with a degree in mining engineering and soon took charge of the firm his father had founded, G. B. Markle and Company, which operated the Jeddo mine. Markle was a successful businessman who became known nationally as the builder of the Jeddo drainage tunnel, which reclaimed Pennsylvania mines inundated by floods in 1886. In April 1884, Markle married Mary Estelle Robinson (1863-1927). The couple moved from Hazelton, Pennsylvania, to New York City in 1902. They had no children. In 1926, John Markle retired from business, and the following year he established the John and Mary R. Markle Foundation with an initial endowment of $3 million. Eventually the total endowment from John Markle reached $15 million. John Markle served as president and treasurer of the Foundation until his death in July 1933. The Foundation was chartered "to promote the advancement and diffusion of knowledge among the people of the United States and to promote the general good of mankind." This charter was broad enough to permit supporting virtually any cause and allowed the directors to spend principal as well as income, which the Foundation did in its early years. (The founder rectified the difference.) Grants, averaging a total of $400,000 annually, went primarily to charities which the Markles had previously supported. In addition, the Markle Foundation gave money to individuals, including relatives and needy strangers who came to John Markle's attention and in whom he took a personal interest.</p>
          <p>After John Markle's death, the Foundation trustees sought direction from Frederick Keppel, president of the Carnegie Corporation of New York. Following his advice, the Foundation changed from a private organization to a focused public foundation. There were no new individual beneficiaries after 1934, and the trustees began to formulate a plan of action. From 1936 to 1945, the Markle Foundation primarily supported medical research: 627 grants were made to 336 projects, and 1,400 scientific papers were published regarding work supported wholly or in part by the Foundation.</p>
          <p>In 1946 John Russell, formerly with the Carnegie Corporation of New York, became the executive director of the Foundation. After making an assessment of the Foundation's work, Russell and the Foundation embarked on an ambitious program - the Markle Scholar Program, which was the principal program of the Markle Foundation from 1947 to 1969. Approximately 25 Markle Scholars were chosen each year. They received five years of financial assistance so that they might continue in academic medicine or research rather than enter more lucrative private practices. A total of 506 Markle Scholars were chosen from 90 medical schools in the United States and Canada.</p>
          <p>In 1969 John Russell retired, and Lloyd Morrisett, also formerly with the Carnegie Corporation of New York, came to the Foundation. In the last months of Russell's tenure, it had been determined that the Markle Scholar program had run its course, and after an evaluation, the Foundation embarked on an ambitious program in the field of mass communications. Beginning in 1969, the Markle Foundation's program aimed to strengthen the performance of the media and to understand the potential of communications technology. Mass communications had not been a traditional focus of philanthropy, and the grants reflect challenge and innovation. Disbursements averaged $2 million annually.</p>

          <p>Charles Emory Culpeper (1874-1940) was born in Rome, Georgia, to a farm family of nine children. Although he never finished high school, he was an industrious young man who worked as a store clerk in the Rome area and later as a traveling salesman. In 1899, Culpeper accepted a job selling Coca-Cola syrup to soda fountains in Philadelphia. In 1904, he was transferred to New York, where he worked as a salesman for the Coca-Cola Bottling Works of Newark and of New York. In 1917, Culpeper bought the two companies for $160,000 and combined them into the Coca-Cola Bottling Company of New York. The company prospered under his direction, and at the time of his death in 1940, his stock in it comprised the bulk of his substantial fortune.</p>
          <p>Culpeper was highly involved in the welfare of children. Throughout his lifetime, he was instrumental in assisting boys' clubs in the New York area. In his will, Culpeper directed that a foundation be established to acquire the bulk of his fortune and conserve it for the benefit of future generations. On December 18, 1940, the Charles E. Culpeper Foundation was established.</p>
          <p>By the late 1980s, the foundation focused its awards in medical science on three areas within the health care system: research, medical education, and clinical services. In 1990, Culpeper Foundation assets totaled approximately $118 million, and it reported disbursements of $6 million in grants that year. In 1999, the Culpeper Foundation merged with the Rockefeller Brothers Fund. A significant portion of the grants the foundation awarded were made during the period 1977-1992. The program also addressed the impact of advances in medical technology and the evolving field of managed care in a changing health care environment, as well as its effect upon individualized patient care. In 1992, support for new information technologies extended program development at secondary schools and offered technical training support for school faculty to develop foreign language curricula.</p>
          <p>From 1993 onward, grants were issued in four broad categories: administration of justice; arts and culture; education; and health. At the college level, the foundation continued to fund computer literacy programs it had supported since the 1980s, and it extended its support to applied technologies in the humanities and social sciences as well. In 1999, the Charles E. Culpeper Foundation closed its offices in Stamford, Connecticut, and transferred its remaining operations to the Rockefeller Brothers Fund in New York City. The Brothers Fund has continued to administer remaining grant contracts and has also awarded additional grants under the terms of the merger agreement. By the end of 2007, all scheduled grants were to be satisfied; the Medical Scholars program continued until around 2010.</p>

          <p>David Dean Rusk was born on February 9, 1909, in Cherokee County, Georgia, the fourth of five children of Robert Hugh Rusk and Francis Clotfelter Rusk. In 1931 he graduated from Davidson College. In 1934, as a Rhodes Scholar at St. John's College at Oxford University, Mr. Rusk earned a master's degree in politics, economics, and philosophy.</p>
          <p>Mr. Rusk then worked at Mills College in Oakland, California, from 1934 to 1940, teaching government and international relations and serving as dean of faculty while also studying law at the University of California at Berkeley. During the Second World War Mr. Rusk, an Army Reserve officer, served on active duty from 1940 until 1946, rising to the rank of colonel.</p>
          <p>Mr. Rusk joined the State Department in 1946 as assistant chief of the division of international security affairs and was later appointed Special Assistant to the Secretary of War. From 1947 to 1949, he was head of the State Department's United Nations desk. From 1949 to 1951, in succession, Mr. Rusk became an Assistant Secretary of State, a Deputy Under Secretary of State, and Assistant Secretary for Far Eastern Affairs.</p>
          <p>In March 1952 Mr. Rusk left the State Department to succeed Chester I. Barnard as president of The Rockefeller Foundation. During his eight years with the Foundation, Mr. Rusk oversaw the distribution of about $250,000,000 for various projects, including aid to underdeveloped nations in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Mr. Rusk also gave numerous speeches to various organizations and institutions and published several articles on U. S. foreign policy, diplomacy, and the role of philanthropy in American society.</p>
          <p>On December 12, 1960, President-elect John F. Kennedy designated Mr. Rusk to be Secretary of State. On January 21, 1961, Mr. Rusk was sworn in to head the State Department. He served in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations until 1969. In 1970 Mr. Rusk returned to Georgia and taught international law at the University of Georgia at Athens until his retirement in 1984.</p>
          <p>Mr. Rusk married Virginia Foisie in 1937. They had three children, David, Richard, and Peggy Smith.</p>
          <p>Mr. Rusk died December 20, 1994, at his home in Athens, Georgia.</p>

          <p>Charles P. Simpson was born in Sullivan, Maine, near Mount Desert Island, on September 19, 1848.  At the age of twenty he headed West, learning the science of engineering in California.  He later settled in Nebraska where he became a land surveyor and part owner in a sawmill and lumberyard.  Simpson married Mary Walworth, of Zanesville, Ohio, in 1874.  In 1880 they and their three children returned to Sullivan, and Simpson established an engineering and surveying office.  He began working for John D. Rockefeller, Jr., in 1913, continuing as Rockefeller's chief engineer for the Seal Harbor carriage roads until he became ill in 1922.  Charles P. Simpson died in 1928.</p>
          <p>Paul Dyer Simpson, Charles P. Simpson's son, took over as Rockefeller's chief engineer at the time of his father's illness.  Born March 10, 1876, in St. Paul, Nebraska, Paul Simpson began his engineering training while working in his father's surveying office in Sullivan.  After serving in the Army during the Spanish-American War he graduated from the University of Maine in 1903 with a degree in civil engineering.  He then worked in the West for eight years for the U.S. Reclamation Service.  Upon his return to Maine in 1912 he again joined his father in the surveying business.  After succeeding his father as Rockefeller's chief engineer in 1922 he continued in that role until 1940, when the roads were incorporated in Acadia National Park.  He then served as a consulting engineer for the Rockefeller family until he retired in 1954.  Paul D. Simpson died at Seal Harbor in 1963.</p>
          <p>The Seal Harbor carriage road system was begun in 1915 when John D. Rockefeller, Jr., already building roads on his private summer estate, received permission from the Hancock County Trustees of Public Reservations to continue the roads across land which they maintained.  The system eventually embraced a 57-mile network of carriage roads laced with sixteen bridges.  The chief architects for the roads were Rockefeller, who laid out the initial line for each road, the two Simpsons, and Walters G. Hill, also a local engineer.  The first ten bridges were designed by Welles Bosworth, the remaining six by Charles Stoughton, both New York City architects.  The roadside landscaping was planned by Beatrix Farrand, who also designed Abby Aldrich Rockefeller's garden at the Eyrie in Seal Harbor.</p>
          <p>Most of the roads were completed by 1930, at which time Rockefeller began the gradual transfer of his property to Acadia National Park.  The transfer was concluded in the early 1940s.  Rockefeller ultimately presented Acadia National Park with 10,700 acres, one-third of the park's size.</p>
