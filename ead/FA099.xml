    <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
<p>Charles Burton Fahs was born in Brooklyn, New York on September 8, 1908. His parents, Sophia (Sophie) Lyon Fahs and Charles Harvey Fahs, who went by Harvey, raised Burton and his sisters Dorothy, Ruth (who died in childhood), and Lois in Brooklyn, New Jersey, and California. Harvey traveled a great deal for his job and was often absent from the family home, leaving Sophie to raise the children on her own. The Fahs parents encouraged exploration and independent thinking among their children and were a very close-knit family, despite Harvey's lengthy absences.</p><p>Following the Fahs family tradition, Burton attended Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois for his undergraduate study, majoring in political science. He also displayed a keen interest for international studies and comparative politics, and he pursued these interests in class as well as in his extracurricular activities, primarily through his membership in the Institute for Oriental Students. Here he met many international students, engaged in discussions and debates over current events, and began to explore diverse cultures through the life experiences of other students.</p><p>Burton completed his undergraduate studies in 1929 and traveled to Europe for the summer. During the 1929-1930 school year, he attended the University of Berlin and enriched his language skills. Burton also attended a variety of German student political meetings, furthering his interest in current events and political systems.</p><p>For the 1930-1931 school year, Burton returned to Northwestern to begin his graduate studies. Burton met Jamie Ross sometime during this period, and they became engaged in 1931 after Burton completed his master's thesis and exams. Jamie had been raised in Colorado Springs, Colorado and had come to Northwestern for a master's degree in Classics. She remained in Evanston after the completion of her degree and worked as a Latin instructor during the couple's courtship and early marriage. Burton and Jamie were married in Colorado Springs, Colorado on June 27, 1932.</p><p>Burton continued his studies during the early years of their marriage, receiving his PhD in 1933 and embarking on three years of study in Japanese language, culture, and politics, first in Paris and then in Kyoto and Tokyo. Jamie traveled with her husband during these years, and the two lived frugally but comfortably on Burton's fellowship stipend. During the year in Paris, Burton and Jamie met Edwin O. Reischauer, a lifelong friend and the American Ambassador to Japan during Burton's employment at the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo. In 1935, their son James Harvey Fahs was born in Kyoto.</p><p>In 1937, the Fahs family returned to the United States and Burton began his academic career as an instructor, and later an assistant professor, at Pomona College in Claremont, California. The family planned for an eighteen month sabbatical in Japan and China for 1940-1941, but their plans abruptly changed with the imminent threat of war. After arriving in Japan, it was decided that Jamie and Jimmie should return to the U.S. while Burton would continue on to China, where he stayed for several months before rejoining his family in California.</p><p>Burton took a leave of absence from Pomona and joined the Office of Strategic Services in the fall of 1941. The family relocated to the Washington, D.C. area, where daughter Barbara Ruth was born in 1943. Burton remained with OSS for the duration of the war, eventually being promoted to Chief of the Research and Analysis Division (Far East). Between October 1944 and February 1945, Burton traveled to China, Burma, and India to assess various overseas research units.</p><p>At the conclusion of World War II, Burton resigned from Pomona College. Within a year, he also resigned from the Department of State (where the Research and Analysis Division had been transferred at the conclusion of the war) to accept a position with the Rockefeller Foundation as Assistant Director in the Humanities Division. In 1950, Burton was appointed Director of the Humanities Division. The Fahs family lived in Fair Lawn, New Jersey during this period. Jamie was elected to the local school board and became involved in Girl Scouts. Burton traveled a great deal for his job with the Rockefeller Foundation, often visiting other parts of the U.S. or foreign countries for 4-6 week periods.</p><p>In 1961, Burton resigned from the Rockefeller Foundation. By 1962, he was appointed Minister-Counselor for Cultural and Public Affairs in the Embassy of the United States in Tokyo, Japan. This appointment was unique and created specifically to match Burton's educational background and talents. The intervention of friends like Dean Rusk and Edwin Reischauer smoothed the way for the creation of this position. Burton and Jamie returned to Tokyo, and both were extremely busy with diplomatic duties and the attendant expectations and social obligations which accompany such a position. During this time, both of their children married; Barbara had her ceremony in Tokyo.</p><p>Burton remained with the Embassy in Tokyo until 1967, and once again the Fahses returned to the United States. Burton accepted a one year academic position as Harry C. Trexler Distinguished Visiting Professor at Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pennsylvania. The following year, Burton was appointed Director of International Studies at Miami University in Miami, Ohio. He and Jamie moved to Oxford, Ohio and settled into a new home. Jamie returned to academic life as well, tutoring students in Latin.</p><p>Burton and Jamie retired from Miami University in 1973, traveling internationally in their retirement and spending time with their growing family. Burton continued his work with Grolier, Inc. during this time, beginning a project to publish a set of encyclopedias in Japanese. This project would ultimately be abandoned.</p><p>Beginning in 1975, Burton experienced serious health problems related to terminal illness. He kept his illness at bay for several years, but his health began to fail significantly in late 1979. It was also this year that marks the presentation of two significant awards, an honorary degree from Miami University and the Japan Foundation Award. Despite his declining health, special arrangements were made so that Burton could travel to Japan to accept this award. Jamie, Jim, and Barbara accompanied him for this momentous occasion.</p><p>Charles Burton Fahs died on February 26, 1980 at the age of 71. A memorial service was held at the Sesquicentennial Chapel at Miami University on March 1, and Burton's ashes were interred in the Oxford Cemetery on August 24 of the same year.</p>  </bioghist>

This series also contains information on Burton's education, and his illness and death.  There are files of correspondence and clippings which post-date Burton's death; these materials were received and collected by Jamie Ross Fahs and were included in the collection because of their connection to Burton's life and career.</p><p>The correspondence folders are extremely rich and detailed and provide a window into the lives and activities of Burton and Jamie throughout their lives.  Folders which begin with the word Correspondence indicate that the letters in the file are written by Burton.  Incoming correspondence is rare, and there are no letters between the spouses.  </p><p>Correspondence from Burton's childhood includes letters written or received by his parents, as well as maternal aunt Abbie Lyon Sharman, her husband Harry Sharman, and maternal uncle D. Willard Lyon and his wife Grace.  Burton was a regular correspondent with his family during his college and graduate school years.  After they were married, Burton and Jamie took turns writing to his family.  There are also a few letters to Jamie's mother.  Both Burton and Jamie were faithful correspondents, writing every one to two weeks.  The letters dating from 1933-1936, when they lived abroad, are particularly fascinating for the details they offer of living conditions and adjustments to cultural differences.  During Burton's career at the Embassy, Jamie served as the family's main correspondent and wrote lengthy letters about both of their activities and travels in Asia.  Annual Christmas letters for the years 1951 through 1980 detail the family life of the Fahses and is the primary source of information about their lives during the period 1951-1961.  </p><p>The files relating to the biography (or biographies) of Charles Burton Fahs all draw from the same material and build upon each other.  Jamie's first biography was based on the oral history interview of Burton conducted by Caroline Bailey at the time of the donation of Burton's library to Earlham College.  To this she added an extensive chronology of his life and selected correspondence and writings.  Finally Jamie and her daughter Barbara attempted a full biography, a draft of which is included.  Jamie also corresponded with Burton's colleagues and their friends for comments on the biography draft and for additional information to enhance the story.</p><p>Burton's later years are chronicled in Jamie's journal, found in Box 4, Folder 56. The four folders of condolences and the programs and readings from the memorial services (Box 3, Folders 35-40) offer a perspective on Burton's interactions and relationships with many colleagues and friends, as well as his impact on Japanese studies, American-Japanese cultural relationships, and international relations. </p><p>A scrapbook (Box 5, Folder 63) about Burton's childhood, created by his mother Sophie, contains his parents' letters and notes about Burton's infancy and childhood, letters from Harvey to his children during his travels, and childhood and teenage letters to Harvey from Burton.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="204728d465a1db3532db596c801941fb"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Files are arranged alphabetically by title, and thereunder

Contents</head><p>Folders in Series 2 document Burton's varied career as an academic, a diplomat, and a foundation officer.  There is minimal documentation for his tenure at Pomona College, the Office of Strategic Services and later Department of State, Muhlenberg College, and Grolier, Inc.  More detailed information exists for his five years at Miami University, and extensive documentation is included for his career at the Rockefeller Foundation and the Embassy of the United States in Tokyo, Japan.  </p><p>The Rockefeller Foundation diaries are an incomplete set and are draft versions of the final diaries filed with the Rockefeller Foundation and found in their archives.  The drafts do not appear to differ significantly from the final versions.</p><p>Of interest in this series is Fahs's report to John Marshall chronicling his train trip from Paris to Kyoto in 1934 (Box 6, Folder 85).  The many reports and memoranda written by Fahs while at the Rockefeller Foundation and at Miami University offer his opinions on education, international study, and cultural exchange and evaluations of proposed changes to study abroad programs and support of universities in developing nations.  The invitations and related materials from his time at the Embassy in Japan are also important items from his diplomatic career.</p><p>Researchers interested in the early career of Charles Burton Fahs should also explore the correspondence files in Series 1 dated from this period; during his early career, there was an overlap between Fahs's personal and professional life.  Series 4, Manuscripts, Publications, and Speeches contains the many articles and book reviews written by Fahs during his time at Pomona College, as well as other articles and speeches made throughout his career.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="5120192b4a01582429be41e687aa67df"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Files in this series are arranged chronologically, and thereunder alphabetically.</p></arrangement><c id="d7a26aa606c04bfb9da91f4c7707925c" level="file"><did><unittitle>Curriculum Vitae and General Career Information</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1935/1972" type="inclusive">1935-1972</unitdate><unitdate normal="1980/1980">1980</unitdate><unitdate normal="1988/1988">1988</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="6b34197cc498d1dc1fd8b1df713ad4ff" label="mixed materials [A0000000053606]" type="box">5</container><container id="4a22d6f038aaf06f7e53338278e6d039" parent="6b34197cc498d1dc1fd8b1df713ad4ff" type="folder">64</container></did></c><c id="c26a631c386244109df8bcd9250ed48b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Pomona College</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1936/1946" type="inclusive">1936-1946</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="8de6b63b97710a7560ce9f4b1a6b0933" label="mixed materials [A0000000053606]" type="box">5</container><container id="d9f643d9df9364744006e1c3cdbe6b96" parent="8de6b63b97710a7560ce9f4b1a6b0933" type="folder">65</container></did></c><c id="4be736fe7ee7468987b5c063ad0f54ef" level="file"><did><unittitle>Pomona College</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1936/1939" type="inclusive">1936-1939</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="cd2e9c761c6c3fcef2a5af3d9d16e2ca" label="mixed materials [A0000000053606]" type="box">5</container><container id="06cb5091a45d98045797f5aeed92b722" parent="cd2e9c761c6c3fcef2a5af3d9d16e2ca" type="folder">65A</container></did><accessrestrict id="36b895ee7c27bac1cc7aae2067f006fa"><head>Conditions Governing Access note</head><p>Restricted from access.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="fe7c3868ae604800a156213b351ea78e" level="file"><did><unittitle>Library of Congress/Coordinator of Information/Office of Strategic Services</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1941/1946" type="inclusive">1941-1946</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="dc4da9ba75adb72366f329f4e1461aa9" label="mixed materials [A0000000053606]" type="box">5</container><container id="ed857fdecdc7657052d2afd1d77303cb" parent="dc4da9ba75adb72366f329f4e1461aa9" type="folder">66</container></did></c><c id="fbadd33e657e434e977ec7fef69db6f5" level="file"><did><unittitle>Library of Congress/Coordinator of Information/Office of Strategic Services</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1941/1946" type="inclusive">1941-1946</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="a85f369306dd8e7397465145b7e79915" label="mixed materials [A0000000053606]" type="box">5</container><container id="8abcf3afffbe441d26b3b7a01c71ba48" parent="a85f369306dd8e7397465145b7e79915" type="folder">66A</container></did><accessrestrict id="6f13aca01e725124a7a1633b4431af95"><head>Conditions Governing Access note</head><p>Restricted from access.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="9937fad9edf5481b9baff431b4c4b65e" level="file"><did><unittitle>Department of State</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1946/1951" type="inclusive">1946-1951</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="59c5977f03c077d30e2809f8f822bfcf" label="mixed materials [A0000000053606]" type="box">5</container><container id="2645fa49e17b8b757a10c3d2b90b7854" parent="59c5977f03c077d30e2809f8f822bfcf" type="folder">67</container></did></c><c id="13a0a13b1eb34093845291177cfd13c7" level="file"><did><unittitle>Department of State</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1946/1951" type="inclusive">1946-1951</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="3ef2dfc9d046edbc73a342ab09469ac3" label="mixed materials [A0000000053606]" type="box">5</container><container id="ae4c8868828b9fd129414af7b18f02be" parent="3ef2dfc9d046edbc73a342ab09469ac3" type="folder">67A</container></did><accessrestrict id="bc2ad0b61888d9976ba993ef30624a67"><head>Conditions Governing Access note</head><p>Restricted from access.</p></accessrestrict></c><c id="65c908a4c06b43278f129908038ee756" level="file"><did><unittitle>Rockefeller Foundation -

Letters were received from a wide range of people, including strangers, acquaintances, and friends and professional colleagues from all stages of Burton's life.  Numerous Rockefeller Foundation colleagues, U.S. diplomats, and Asian scholars and politicians corresponded with Burton.  Letters can be quite brief and perfunctory, or they can be lengthy and full of warmth and collegiality.  </p><p>Correspondence dating after 1980 was received by Jamie Ross Fahs, who incorporated her letters into her husband's files.  Generally these letters include information about Burton's relationship with the correspondent.</p><p>Important correspondents in this series include:  John Kenneth Emmerson, Naomi Fukuda, Clifton Forster, Richard H. Minear, Virginia Moreno, Shigeharu Matsumoto, John E. Reinhardt, Edwin O. Reischauer, Flora Rhind, Dean Rusk, Shio Sakanishi, Margaret Shedd, and David H. Stevens.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="09a1827ca41fdc54e91915702cacd2fc"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Files in this series are arranged alphabetically, and individually named folders are filed

There are very few candid, personal, or family photographs.  The majority of the photographs are black and white; there are a few color photographs.  Most of the photographs are captioned; the captioning was often added to by Jamie Ross Fahs, and occasionally the dates are incorrect.</p><p>The earliest photographs in this series are Burton's snapshots from his travels through Europe in 1929 and 1930.  Photographs taken on Rockefeller Foundation trips are significant, as they often document Burton's visits with artists, writers, and academics of other countries.  Photographs taken during the Embassy years document Burton in meetings and at conferences, as well the Fahs' taking part in official ceremonies and outings.  Photographs from various awards ceremonies often document Fahs with other important academics, dignitaries, and politicians.  Rare family images are the portrait of Burton, Jamie, Jimmie, and Barbara at the Medal of Freedom award ceremony in 1946, one photograph of the family at Jim's wedding, and one photograph from Barbara's wedding to Nicholas Charles.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="789f667f28780c316e77f7141243b8ae"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The photographs are arranged chronologically, and the passport photos are filed first.
