    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The Environmental Grantmakers Association was formed in 1987 after a meeting in Washington, D. C. of environmental funders who had common interests and wanted to learn about other organizations. It resulted in a 12 member foundation from across the United States that discussed and exchanged ideas from their home organizations. Over the years the foundation has grown to over 200 members from around the world.</p><p>Some of their notable programs have been: nurtured working groups and responsive projects; held Federal, State, and Regional Policy Briefings; produced research publications for members, a peer-edited semi-annual EGA Journal; organized a variety of lectures, site visits, leadership trainings; maintained email listservs for the quick sharing of ideas and questions; implemented organizational reviews and strategic plans; facilitated community and collaboration through the work of volunteer committees; and supported and challenged the membership in their work.</p>  </bioghist>
