    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The collection contains the office files Laine Romero-Alston created when she worked as a Program Officer in the Ford Foundation's inclusive economic development programs. Files document the progression of Romero-Alston's work at the Foundation from managing Next Generation Workforce Strategies grants in the Quality Employment unit of the Economic Opportunity and Assets Program (EOA) to managing Quality Work and Economic Security (QWRS) grants in Inclusive Economies (IE). Romero-Alston also worked on the Foundation's Future of Work (FOW) initiative. </p><p>The collection consists of two series. Notebooks Romero-Alston created through her activities are contained in the first series.  Romero-Alston's subject files are contained in the second series. </p><p>Files in the collection document Romero-Alston's leadership of the Ford Foundation's programming for supporting sustainable and inclusive workforce development. Grants and initiatives focused on global workers, immigrant and migrant workers, informal workers, service workers in various industries, low-wage workers, worker centers, labor unions, job quality, workers' rights, human rights, global labor, and global supply chains. There is a lot of focus on strategy and capacity building and the increasing global perspective of the Foundation's workforce development and job quality programming through the emergence of QWES in IE. </p><p>Common material formats found throughout the collection include correspondence, memos, notes, proposals, reports, meeting materials, drafts, budget spreadsheets, articles, and publications.</p>  </scopecontent>
