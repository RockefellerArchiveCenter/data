      <p>SCOPE AND CONTENT</p>
      <p>This series consists of more than 80 volumes of aggregated factual material on both national and state issues. The Issue Books contain statements and press releases issued by the Gubernatorial Press Office in response to important political and policy issues, as well as other substantive material. Governor Rockefeller also had many experts write background papers on various subjects relevant to the two campaigns. In most cases, these papers are coupled with summary papers or supporting memoranda for Governor Rockefeller to assist him with the formulation of a position on the issue.</p>

          <p>The volumes in this subseries contain memoranda from Governor Rockefeller's staff and advisors. Much of the material was prepared under the supervision of Roswell B. Perkins, one of Rockefeller's chief advisors. Found throughout the volumes are draft "Platform Planks" submitted for consideration in the 1964 Republican Party Platform, as well as selections from the "Current Positions Notebook," which outlined Governor Rockefeller's stands on a variety of issues. This subseries also includes many background papers written by consultants hired by Governor Rockefeller. The material in this subseries was primarily gathered for the 1964 Presidential election, and therefore a majority of the material contains analyses of Kennedy and Johnson administration proposals and stands on issues, as well as evaluations of positions held by Senator Barry M. Goldwater. Campaign-related materials (pamphlets, position cards) are also found in this series.</p>

          <p>The volumes in this subseries contain memoranda from Governor Rockefeller's staff and advisors focused on New York State issues. Primarily the subseries is composed of statements and speeches made by Governor Rockefeller on issues affecting New York, one of the country's most populous states. Of note in this subseries are press releases issued by the Governor's office of "Veto Memorandum" to indicate why the Governor chose not to sign an Assembly or Senate bill into law. There are also copies of enacted legislation. Also found in this subseries are a number of campaign statements issued by the Rockefeller campaign prior to the 1958 election. At the end of each year are summaries prepared by staff that denote accomplishments achieved by the administration on the various issues.</p>
