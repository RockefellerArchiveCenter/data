<p>SCOPE AND CONTENT</p><p>This series consists of more than 80 volumes of aggregated factual material on both national and state issues. The Issue Books contain statements and press releases issued by the Gubernatorial Press Office in response to important political and policy issues, as well as other substantive material. Governor Rockefeller also had many experts write background papers on various subjects relevant to the two campaigns. In most cases, these papers are coupled with summary papers or supporting memoranda for Governor Rockefeller to assist him with the formulation of a position on the issue.</p>  </scopecontent>

Much of the material was prepared under the supervision of Roswell B. Perkins, one of Rockefeller's chief advisors. Found throughout the volumes are draft "Platform Planks" submitted for consideration in the 1964 Republican Party Platform, as well as selections from the "Current Positions Notebook," which outlined Governor Rockefeller's stands on a variety of issues. This subseries also includes many background papers written by consultants hired by Governor Rockefeller. The material in this subseries was primarily gathered for the 1964 Presidential election, and therefore a majority of the material contains analyses of Kennedy and Johnson administration proposals and stands on issues, as well as evaluations of positions held by Senator Barry M. Goldwater. Campaign-related materials (pamphlets, position cards) are also found in this series.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_6794388ca4494373bd1c8f840af5b8f9" level="file"><did><unittitle>Volume 1 - General Materials - Domestic and Foreign</unittitle><unitdate normal="1959/1960" type="inclusive">1959-1960</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="aspace_e16e3b373f301a1cb386f8dc80bce84c" label="Mixed Materials [A0000000055423]" type="box">1</container><container id="aspace_3cea82d260ef3d20b2f59c8027140442" parent="aspace_e16e3b373f301a1cb386f8dc80bce84c" type="folder">1</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_ceebd8ec85a7d055515939234c25e172"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>Tab 1 Position Papers - Domestic Issues, June 1960 -- full position papers primarily drafted by Roswell Perkins and Barbara Jones.
