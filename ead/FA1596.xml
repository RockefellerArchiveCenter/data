<p>The Commonwealth Fund records are arranged in three subgroups, each comprised of multiple series and/or accessions. The subgroups and associated series numbers are representative solely of when the materials were processed by RAC, and do not imply an original order of the records. Additional finding aids are created as records are processed and open for research.</p><p>Subgroup 2 is arranged in 20 series or collections, primarily by record type or division/program.</p><p>This collection of Commonwealth Fund records, Subgroup 2 Grants is further divided into six sets of records by Accession. The accessions were transferred to RAC from 2000-2013.</p>  </arrangement>
