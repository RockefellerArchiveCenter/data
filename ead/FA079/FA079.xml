    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The American International Association for Economic and Social Development (AIA) (1946-1968), was established by Nelson A. Rockefeller in July 1946 as a privately financed non-profit philanthropic organization which aimed to promote "self-development and better standards of living, together with understanding and cooperation" in Latin America. The AIA worked closely with local governments and other established organizations to develop programs which could eventually be supported and managed locally. Primarily, the AIA's activities focused on rural rehabilitation and agricultural development, with concentrated efforts on cooperative programs with the governments of Brazil and Venezuela. The AIA was also active in agricultural research and nutritional education as well as improving local roads, communications, and primary education.</p><p>AIA programs included the Association of Credit and Rural Assistance (ACAR), Inter-American Council on Nutrition Education (CIDEA), Council of Rural Development (CBR), and Inter-American Popular Information Program (PIIP).</p>  </bioghist>

Jose is a young man and is already profiting greatly in the technical service he is receiving even before the closing of his loan. 2.

Wilkey, farm management specialist, and applicant Jose look at his cattle to decide which should be culled out and sold. 3. Applicant Jose Nicodemos Costa upon advice of supervisor Pedreira did not wait for his loan to purchase this good purebred Guernsey bull. Guernseys probably survive the climate here better than other milk breeds, being also more resistant to the prevalent hoof and mouth disease. Pure bred USA milk cattle do not survive the climate here, but have to be mixed with native breeds in order to get a good milk production. Applicant Jose has not yet fully "made friends" with the bull, but he has confidence in the outcome.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="e09e265ffb434dad9924c62f43d061d9" level="file"><did><unittitle>ACAR, Pedro Leopaldo, Home Improvement</unittitle><physdesc id="482a6c8118c17d6ce6afb055f6dc78b6"><extent>Prints: 3</extent></physdesc><container id="2f1bf6533430b589aecfb45c18c76b01" label="mixed materials [461036.3.318]" type="box">3</container><container id="b90eaff768925ca0ed26b1387aecc723" parent="2f1bf6533430b589aecfb45c18c76b01" type="folder">63</container></did><scopecontent id="156771218645a8f808fa441164d612ab"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>4.

Sebastiao and Supervisor Gazzinelli discussing relative merits of hybrid corn over common corn. This is Sebastiao's first harvest of hybrid corn. 6. Borrower Batista Sergio da Silveira owned several cattle which he was going to have to sell in order to finance this production of squash which is a good money crop in Brazil. Batista is a good worker but he was living on rented land which was being sold and he was forced to buy a small part in order to remain on the place. The down payment on this land would have crippled his production without ACAR help. Under advice of supervisor Pedro Morais he has three plantings to better distribute work requirements and insure better market for his product. 7.

The value of using such supplemental feed is being taught by ACAR supervisors and the construction of this mill was done under ACAR direction. It is powered by water. 8.

Dr. Armando Castillo Plaza, Director of the Aragua State Sanitary Zone, present leaders of the "Health Battalion" with a flag at the inauguration of C.I.D.E.A.'s Experimental Center in San Casimiro on April 9. The first duty of the 120 schoolboys, who make up the battalion for better health and sanitation, is to turn up at the C.I.D.E.A. center each afternoon for their daily glass of milk. 296. After eight weeks of cooking, sewing and gardening, nineteen girls from the village of San Casimiro in the mountains of southern Aragua State received certificates of completion of C.I.D.E.A.'s elementary home economics classes. Diplomas were awarded at the official inauguration of the organization's San Casimiro Center, which was attended by city and sate government officials and representatives of the Ministry of Health and the National Public Nutrition Institute. 297.

The only Venezuelan wheat is grown on the temperate Andean slopes, and CBR economists have found that it seldom is a moneymaking crop. The farmers usually consume the flour themselves, paying for having it ground at primitive mills, such as the one shown, with a portion of the crop. 2. Brick and tile kilns are of various types and shapes as they exist in areas where clay products are fired in the Andes. Pictured is a relatively large kiln with fire box below the area where brick and tile are placed. 3. Generation of electricity has increased in the Andes during recent years. But most of the increase has been accomplished in small motor driven plants few of which are as large as the plant shown here at Valera. 4. A drug store located on the main street of the town of Santo Domingo, in the State of Merida is shown in this picture. In this store are sold not only medicinal products but also other articles of basic necessities. This lack of commercial specialization is characteristic of the small business establishments which are the predominant type in the Andean region. 5. Vegetables can be grown in the Andes in some areas and especially where irrigation water is available with a good comparative advantage over low tropical areas as far as quality and quantity of production is concerned. The better valley bottom soils could well be used for this purpose with good possibilities of reasonable economic return for the high labor and other cost input required for vegetables. 6. An illegal distillery of rudimentary construction, which was confiscated by the National Guards near Banco de Barinas in the southeast part of Tachira is shown in this picture. In the Andean region there are foreigners who try to augment their income through this illegal activity. In 1952, in the State of Tachira only, 836 illegal distilleries were discovered with an estimated average production of 40 meters per unit. 7. Pasture maintenance practices in many areas of the Andes still call for annual burning of old grasses as shown here above Palmira in Tachira. Considerable work is necessary in carrying out experiments in technological methods and in demonstrating improved practices to farmers so that unit productivity can be increased and destructive resource use diminished. 8. Very careful soil conservational practices are needed, including contour planting, strip cropping with permanent sod crops and other practices, for safe use of land with 30% slope as that pictured in the left hand side of this photo. An annual crop of field peas is shown. 9. Vegetable farming methods in the Andes still call for the use of the wooden plow and oxen for plowing. This field in Tachira in which a crop of cabbage and cauliflower had already been produced during the year was being prepared for a second crop of tomatoes and carrots. Some farmers attempt triple cropping during a season in this area. 10. The hand tools typically used in annual crop farm areas as well as most other types of farming are shown here. Notice the heavy "palas" leaned up against the box which are used both for digging and hoeing. The wedge shaped piece of metal on the box to the right of the shovel handle is an iron plow tip for use on the wooden plows. A few farmers use such tips but most plows are all wood. Notice the absence of the light type garden hoe which is easier to use than the heavy hoes and palas pictured for many hand operations in tilling crops. 11. Production of sugar cane on steep hillside areas in the Andes is common. However, most agronomists and cost conscious farmers believe that such production is uneconomic because of low yields and extra expenses of land preparation and harvesting on slope areas. Sugar cane does best on the level riverside areas where irrigation water is available and some mechanization of field operations can be accomplished. 12. Annual crops planted regularly on slopes as steep as that shown for the corn in this picture can do little else than destroy the top soil available. This slope is about 80 percent and it is common to see such steep slopes used for annual crops in the Andes. 13. Old style vertically mounted presses for extracting sugar cane juice are still found in use, especially on farms where the juice is used for guarapo rather than panels. Commercial producers of sugar cane usually have machine powered trapiches available. 14. Part of the dwellings are utilized for the limited processing of annual crops as shown here for tobacco. Seldom are special sheds facilities constructed for better control of the processing operations for any annual crops. 15. Livestock farmers ordinarily have to deliver their cattle for sale at central market areas. Buyers seldom come to the ranch to complete sales. Cattle are shown here en route over a jungle trail to a highway where they will be trucked to San Cristobal for sale. 16. The straight type "pala" is used most frequently for the hoeing vegetables. Shown here is a farmer hoeing and hilling up onions in the Flor Marin area of Tachira. 17. The wooden plow as pictured here is still used almost exclusively on annual crop farms and vegetable farms throughout the Andes. These plows will last two or three years when used for plowing three or four hectares per year. Two oxen are used to pull them. The steep slopes cultivated by Andean farmers preclude the use of any buy hand-wielded implements. 18. The Andean area is dependent on the Llanos areas for most of the livestock fattened or kept for dairy cows in the mountain areas. The picture shows a herd of cattle being driven through the Uribante valley en route to fattening zones in Tachira. 19. Planting sticks (coas) are used most frequently for planting corn and beans and some other crops on annual crop farms. Shown here is a man planting beans. Often two men work at planting. The first makes the hole with the stick and the second places the seeds and steps on the hole to cover them. 20. Cana Imperial is another improved soilage type grass which appears to do well in some livestock areas of the Andes as shown here near San Cristobal in Tachira. Greater use of improved pastures appears to be desirable development in many areas now used for annual crops but more information on cultural methods practical for the ecological conditions in the Andes is necessary. 21. After the burning process which was previously pictured the land is planted, in this case to corn, without further soil tilling in the shifting cultivation system of farming. The men in the picture are preparing to plant with a planning stick and a mattock for use in the steeper areas. 22. One of the few areas where small, one family livestock farms are prevalent in the Andes is located in the "caserio" of Sabana Grande in the State of Tachira. Pasture production in such high valley areas constitutes a more reasonable land use than annual crop production customary in many other zones with similar land resources. 23. After boiling down the sugar cane juice in from three to five vats the remaining sugar and molasses is molded in square cakes weighing about one pound as shown here. For shipping the panela is wrapped in banana or wild plantain type leaves usually with 96 cakes per pack or "bulto". Two of these packs make a "carga" for mule transport. 24. The outside view of a typical sugar cane trapiche used in the Andean area shows the heavy smokestack and the pile of bagasse which is used as fuel along with wood in the furnace heating the boiling vats. 25. The most frequently used sugar cane trapiche in the Andes is the three roller press pictured here. The sugar cane juice which can be seen coming out of the side of the machine passes through a tube to an adjoining room where the boiling vats are located which reduce the juice to panela. 26. Corn is usually dried before shelling at the house either by hanging the ears on racks as shown or spreading on the ground or hung with the husks on under eaves of houses. 27. Special drying facilities or mechanical shellers are very scarce in the Andes. Livestock care practices on farms are minimal in the Andes and one sees often animals badly infested with "nuche" as that shown here. Inexpensive contrils are known for the flies and the grubs which infest the animals but very few livestock farmers use such control methods and consequently both quality and quantity of livestock and livestock products suffer. 28. In areas where tree and brush growth is old one butting and burning does not clear the land and it must be done a second time. The unburned sticks have been stacked for better drying and the grass has been cut with machetes preparing for a second burning. 29. Planting of improved pasture grasses has been accomplished in several livestock farms in the Andes as illustrated by this field of Guinea Grass in Tachira. However, continuous experimentation to determine and demonstrate best cultural practices and varieties is not being accomplished now. 30. No caption. 31. Exploitation of lumber resources in the Andes is not of great economic importance at the present time. There are a few saw mills that are pictured either in the piedmont areas or some areas in the State of Merida at high altitudes. 32. Coal deposits near Lobatera are utilized to a limited extent by strip mining methods. Very few of the old hand operated mines are operating today. 33. A recently constructed cement plant between Palmira and Lobatera in Tachira is one of the largest industrial plants in the Andes. 34. Tile manufacturing plants with few exceptions are small businesses scattered in rural areas. Some farm people obtain off-farm employment in such plants as pictured here. 35. Andean miller grinds the wheat crop of Chachopo in Merida. The motif of the cross on the primitive apparatus is typical of this extremely religious community. 36. An Andean housewife prepares a meal much in the manner of her primitive forebears. This kitchen of Aristides Cardenas in the village of Flor Marin, is more elaborate than many in rural Venezuela where housewives do the cooking over simple "fogones", wood fires encircled by stones. 37. Skills are passed from one generation to another with the family. 38. Tobacco was one of the first well known expert crops from the Andes as far back as the 16th Century when colonization first started in the area. It is not of major importance economically for the region now but is still grown and processed in much the same way as it was done in colonial times. It is dried under the eaves of houses as shown in the photograph taken in the dry Chama Valley area below Merida. 39. The thatched roof and festoons of drying; tobacco give this Andean cottage a particularly shaggy look. 40. Coloncita is a typical village of the plains area of Tachira, below the Andes which rise sharply a bit farther west. It is located on the new Panamerican highway between La Fria and El Vigia, virgin territory which is being colonized rapidly since it's opening by the road. 41. A convite near San Miguel, locally organized for the purpose of building a camino vicinal. 42. The most frequent pattern of this distribution of the rural population in the Andes is the grouping of small houses into communities. The houses are grouped in the bottom of a valley, on the sides, or on the crest of a mountain and generally constitute a social community. In this photo we see, in the high Chama valley, some houses grouped on an alluvial fan, a very frequent location for the scattered communities of the high valleys of the Andes. 43. The photo shows an example of so-called "nomad farming", a practice common in the Venezuelan Andes. The farmer, who seldom own the lands and merely squats or share-crops, move from land where the soil is leached to another patch and allows that which he formerly farmed to lie fallow for a period. 44. No caption. 45. Demonstration of practices for the conservation of soil at Mucuchies. 46. Of the three crops universally raised by Andean farmers on their rugged, eroded slopes: corn, wheat and potatoes, CBR agricultural economist Louis Heaton says only potatoes yield a return, and it is neither secure nor rewarding. 47. Life is hard; the land is poor and the days are cold for the mountain dwellers in the high Venezuelan Andes. CBR economist knows that many of these farmers who crop their poor soil should turn their land to pasture and raise animals, but such conversion requires credit and technical training. 48. Farming is intensive and divided into small plots in the Merida mountain valley of Apartaderos. 49. This woman, another rope factory worker, twists the cords at one end while the young girl (whose photo is also included) winds it with a wheel. 50. A demonstrational supervised credit program has been carried on in Tachira with the Banco Agricola y Pecuario collaborating with CBR this week. Shown in the picture is a CBR supervisor discussing with a farmer production and marketing problems as a follow-up on the annual farm and home plan which has been prepared by the farmer with the aid of the technician.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="06f49280ba8c4d45a139b28f3b45eb73" level="file"><did><unittitle>CBR, Andean Study</unittitle><physdesc id="5c23e7eac54b8c88aadca9ff8568343d"><extent>Prints: 50</extent></physdesc><container id="f20040cab972a299671031db264c9c4c" label="mixed materials [461149.8.318]" type="box">8</container><container id="1b3019acf8737e545e275ca35f5a8c06" parent="f20040cab972a299671031db264c9c4c" type="folder">158</container></did><scopecontent id="c51bea996a231ee6e751db40ffd94180"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>51. The central market locations in the Andean area have not developed special facilities for parking or loading platform spaces so truck drivers are forced to use congested street areas for loading and unloading agricultural products brought to the market area either for local sale or transshipment to other market areas. The picture shows a street near the Municipal market in San Cristobal. 52. A commercial dry goods store typical of the area and located in a town in the State of Tachira is shown in this picture. Most of the stores in the Andean region are made up on small establishments usually "one-man businesses" characterized by their limited use of capital and the lack of specialization in the commercial and retail functions. 53. The small "pulperia" is the retail outlet me frequently found in the Andes. These stores sell dried and canned foods, hardware, and clothing, tobacco, and numerous other items. These usually have limited stocks and are run by one family. 54. This Mucuchies sheep farmer is carrying his prize to market while his wife leads two others. 55. An Andean street scene in the town of Santo Domingo, high in the mountains of the state of Merida. 56. The millers of Chachopo is a versatile citizen; he spins and weaves the tough fabric for making the familiar Venezuelan "alpargato" or sandal which is worn throughout the country as a sideline to grinding the wheat of his neighbors. 57. This is an old sugar mill still operating at Mendoz Fria in the state of Trijillo. 58. No caption. 59. Among the present Andean huts constructed by the farmers of this high valley of the state of Merida, many are similar to those built by the old Timotes Indians. In spite of strong Spanish influence and the total disappearance of the Indian in the Andes, the pre-Colombian cultural characteristics still maintained in the region are quite noticeable. 60. Clay is also utilized for making vases by hand methods. The photograph shows one of these rudimentary home industries located at La Ovejera, one of the most arid and eroded zones in the Andes, in the Capacho District, State of Tachira. 61. The "unchanging" Andes. 62. Roads have been improved a great deal in the Andes in recent years. However, access roads to many farm areas are still not available so dependence on expensive mule transportation is still necessary. A "recua" of mules laden with coffee and panela are shown entering Bailadores after a day and a half trip from Southern Merida. 63. The Agricultural and Livestock Bank (BAP) is one of the official organizations whose object is to finance farmers through the concession of credit under liberal terms and in adequate amounts required for agricultural production. This photo shows the entrance to a branch of this institution which is established in San Cristobal. 64. At Escaguey on the Chama River above Merida, is located the largest flour mill in the Andes which is a private business engaged in the manufacture of macaroni products in addition to milling flour. 65. Hides are processed into leather at a fairly well mechanized tannery at San Cristobal. The men are shown selecting the finished tanned hides which will be rolled up and sold to various leather working shops mostly in the Andean Area. 66. Slaughter of beef is usually done in Municipo owned slaughter houses. However, in the small villages slaughter for community use is done without any special facilities as show here. As pictured here, the beef was killed, dressed, cut up and sold on the ground with the hide serving as the table and sales counter. All that was left when the picture was taken was the hide and the offal which the owner carried back to his farm. 67. Home conveniences are few in most Andean homes both in the Tropical Valleys in the piedmont areas and in the high cold areas. Pictured are the kitchen facilities in a home in the Uribante Valley area which is not unusual. Many women in all areas of the Andes have to cook over open fires on the floor. Others have a stone platform on which the open fire is built. Others have kerosene stoves whose use has increased in recent years. 68. The minifundial system perpetuates a low level of living. This choza is located on the Loma of San Miguel in Turjillo. 69. On farm marketing is seldom possible on Andean annual crop farms and a great deal of time is expended in taking small lots of products to towns for sale usually to merchants. Pictured is a burro loaded with yucca and corn with two members of farm family going to market. It required a full day for these two persons to market less than Bs 30 worth of product. 70. On farm marketing of vegetables is not practiced to any great extent in the Andes. Mules are used most frequently to carry products to the town markets for sale. Pictured are a group of farmers each with one mule and a load of onions going to the free market at Independencia, Tachira. 71. No caption. 72. A critical need still exists for more access roads from the through trunk highways to farm areas. Pictured is short section of road built by the cooperative action of a group of farmers in Tachira who by the joint expenditure of labor and some funds to construct less than a kilometer of access road were able to reduce greatly the number of mules they had to maintain on their small farms to haul coffee and other products to market. It also made it possible for more of the children in the area to go to school and participate in other community affairs. 73. View of the railroad station at La Fria on the railroad between Encontrados and Estacion Tachira. Even though the value of cargo transported by railroad of the region was important in the past, the competition of trucks has substantially reduced the traffic of merchandize and passengers by this means of transportation. Already the railroad between La Ceiba and Motatan in the State of Trujillo has been paralyzed and abandoned. 74. Due to the opening of new communication routes and the improvement and increase in the number of automotive vehicles, there has been a considerable decrease in freight rates on the roads in the Andean region. However, the lack of total access roads still makes it necessary to transport the agricultural products from many areas by muleback. This reduces and in some cases nullifies the advantages of the Andean economy represented by the progress in ways and means of road transportation. 75. The tannery plant at San Cristobal as shown in this interior view has machinery and vats for handling a significant volume of hides. 76. No caption. 77. Long use of steep slope lands for annual crops has brought about erosion problems which have attracted government programs for control. Pictured are contour stone fences constructed under government sponsorship in a demonstration area near Mucuchies, Merida. Strip cropping with permanent sod crops are usually necessary for soil conservation on slope lands used for annual crops but such is seldom practiced in the Andes. 78. In the foreground to the left may be seen an example of erosion frequently found in the Andean farmland. CBR economists consider that much land now cropped should be turned to pasture, but such conversion requires technical advice and credit. 79. A large number of the rural Andean population still moves about on foot or muleback and continues to use the old roads and bridges which are usually in bad condition. In such a rugged region as the Andes, where roads are still undeveloped and the population scattered through the mountains, mule trails continue to be the most frequent means of communication, although slow and expensive. 80. A primitive Andean bridge crosses a mountain stream near Mucuraba in Merida. 81. Each populated zone in the Andean region has stimulated the development of an urban agglomeration which functions as the political, commercial, and cultural center of the area. The capitals of Tachira and Merida, for example, are together with Valera in Trujillo, the main focus of their own states and the other important populated zones which exist within each state area are secondary center of a part of the State. Tovar, seen in this photo, is a typical example of a secondary urban center which in this case serves as the focus of the western section of the state of Merida. 82. Tovar is a typical Andean town, tile-roofed and clustered around a central plaza with a handsome colonial cathedral. 83. The Free Market at Tachira. Tachira is a busy place on the one day a week it operates. Such free markets are located at nine other locations in the Andes and are sponsored by the Ministry of Agriculture. 84. Road improvements along main routes are shortening the transportation time between the Andes and the large cities in Venezuela. The new road along the Llanos states of Cojedes, Portuguesa and Barinas with a tie-in road to the Transandean highway through Barinitas and Santo Domingo in Merida as shown in this picture is very helpful in this respect. 85. Newly cut roads in steep mountain country are difficult to maintain because of slides and washouts. The section pictured on the Barinitas - Santo Domingo road in Merida paralyzes traffic occasionally creating problems of spoilage of perishable agricultural products. 86. The Transportation highway has been widened and improved in many areas in recent years but the spectacular switchbacks are still necessary on both sides of the high paramo areas. 87. A policy of price and support is operative for a few products in the Andes charged to the Banco Agricola y Pecuario. The illustrated notice was well distributed in areas where Bank agencies were functioning. However, in the case of corn for the 1952 and 1953 crops the Bank was unable to buy all the corn offered because of lack of facilities to handle the corn and many farmers had to take prices almost half the support price to get rid of their crop. 88. Half of the Andean region is still covered with forest and even within the populated areas large extensions of land with little population remain. This aerial photograph of a zone between La Fundation and Los Naranjos, along the Uribante river, represents one of the typical populated areas of low density where the scattered "conucos" and "potreros" leave to the forest at least 50% of the land. 89. In the valley of the Motatan river, near Chachopo, Merida, there are three wheat mills at work. They are rudimentary and of small capacity and this is where the farmers transform their cereal into whole wheat flour before selling it. In payment for their service, the mills take a share of the wheat equivalent to 80% of the total wheat milled (4kgs out of each 50kgs). The photograph shows the primitive stone wheel turned by water power which is used as the grinding device in these mills. 90. The "frailejon" plant is identified with the Andean Paramo areas. Its bunches of silvery white leaves can be seen for great distances. Other planes growing at these high altitudes are all stunted type shrubs and convey the impression of the high areas above 3000 meters altitude and often describe a large part of the Andean area based on this impression. 91. Towns and villages constitute a different type of rural agglomeration but are not too frequent in the Andes. Outside of the municipio capitals these agglomerations are generally few. Situated at strategic points they serve as focus for the farmers who live in the immediate surroundings. As in Peribeca, small village in the Capacho district which appears in this photo, a grouping of this type includes a church, a school, a dispensary and some small commercial establishments. 92. The construction of a road into the San Camilo forest in the southern part of the State of Tachira recently caused a heavy migration of Andean farm families towards these plains at the foot of the mountain range. Begun 10 years ago this road was continued in 1952 and 1953 and it was then that it produced its attraction. As one can see, in the two comparative drawings in Map #11, the farmers construct their houses along the new road and rapidly deforest the land. 93. The alluvial terraces constitute together with the riverside areas most of the level land existing in the Andes. These mesas composed in part by materials of glacial origin are sometimes fertile and cultivatable even though they are rocky. The land near Timotes, which appears in this photo, is generally utilized for the production of annual field crops and vegetables and also for pasture. From the bed of the River Motatan one can see the successive terraces raising like giant stairways. 94. A shifting cultivation farm is pictured here in the Santo Domingo river valley, Merida, showing the small patch of corn and the various other patches of abandoned land with brush growth from two to fifteen years of age which will be cleared in succession for later crops. 95. Part of the land preparation for planting on a shifting cultivation form is shown here. The brush and trees have been previously cut after an expenditure of many days of human labor and the area is being burned to remove the dried brush and trees as well as much of the organic layer developed on the soil by the plant growth over a period of several years. 96. Where fairly large stumps are left which are difficult to cut out by hand the crop is planted among the stumps as shown in this picture for a shifting cultivation farm. 97. Small areas in the Capacho district of Tachira are devoted to the production of vegetables. Pictured here in the foreground is cabbage and on the mesa farther back are beds of onions and garlic. 98. The excessive fragmentation of annual crop farms can be seen in this picture. Five farm families are dependent on about 6 hectares of crop land for their livelihood in this scene in the Capacho district of Tachira. 99. While scientific seed selection to develop varieties of annual crops adapted for Andean conditions are not being continuously carried on a natural selection has developed a dwarf type of corn which is produced in some of the higher altitude areas where other cricolla varieties will not produce. Pictured are a few plants of this dwarf variety near Bailadores, Merida. 100. Annual crop farms in the lower altitude areas, as that shown here for a farm in the Capacho District of Tachira, usually use a larger portion of the total land area each year than do such farms at higher altitudes. The period of land rest between crops is less at the lower and warmer altitudes. The pictured farm is using about one-half of the available crop land each year.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="3e4ddc87eeac4538882ebe33996edd24" level="file"><did><unittitle>CBR, Andean Study</unittitle><physdesc id="a4cad0499a98b8e083122703dcd46d33"><extent>Prints: 50</extent></physdesc><container id="3a046e3bef741096c5680811f05b06bb" label="mixed materials [461149.8.318]" type="box">8</container><container id="0be69657f255d6f94bfcb1d936e56746" parent="3a046e3bef741096c5680811f05b06bb" type="folder">159</container></did><scopecontent id="604221ddd8c732527dffa248fa9b059e"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>101. Corn and bean are often inter-planted as shown here on annual crop farms in the Andes. A volunteer squash plant also shows in this picture which got into this field by accident. 102. In a few locations in the Andes as shown here for a farm near Tovar, Merida, pasture production has already replaced steep slope annual crop farming. On slopes as abrupt as those shown a permanent type crop is much desirable than crops requiring annual plowing which the pictured area was previously subjected to. 103. The better sugar cane production areas in the perennial cash crop system of farming are located in the more level valley bottoms where irrigation water can be used. Pictured is the Momboy river valley from La Puerta looking down valley toward Mendoza Fria and Valera which is one of the larger and most intensive sugar cane producing areas in the Andes. 104. Systematic pruning of coffee plants to control the size of the plant and encourage new week growth which bears the crop is seldom done in the Andes. Pictured is a typical grove in which the coffee plants have never been pruned and volunteer plants between the original plantings have been allowed to grow making weeding and harvesting operations more difficult and expensive. 105. Shifting cultivation of annual crops is carried on usually in relatively inaccessible areas where land is at a minimum. It can be recognized by the patchy appearance as shown in the accompanying photo. Actual crop areas are small and the abandoned land shows brush at various stages of growth indicating the shifting use and the long time land rotation use practiced. 106. The trend of gradual withdrawal of some land from cropping use in the Andes is most dramatically seen in the old Capacho area in the State of Tachira. The slopes in the distance formerly were used for cropping and pastures but today have been completely abandoned because continual cropping to soil depleting crops and erosion have destroyed its productivity. 107. Attempts to grow coffee, the most important perennial cash crop in the Andes, without shade have generally proved unsuccessful. Pictured are coffee plants which made good initial growth in an area with high incidence of cloudy days but failed to withstand the direct rays of the sun for a few extended periods and had to be abandoned. 108. Today there is still a great lack of secondary and rural access roads to connect the whole rural Andean population with the main roads and cities of the region. Construction of such access roads is difficult in view of the ruggedness of the Andes but it is indispensable in order to integrate into the Andean economy the numerous isolated agricultural zones which still exist in the area. In the southeastern part of Tachira and southwestern part of Merida, for example, there are some 55,000 inhabitants in urgent need of secondary and rural access roads. 109. There are two modern refrigerated storage plants in the Andes belonging to the Agricultural and Livestock Bank. However, there are not utilized in an efficient manner. Even then the markets are really flooded and products are spoiling the refrigerated storage space goes unutilized. The market gluts which occur indicate the need for storage facilities to stabilize prices by equaling supply and demand but so far the facilities available have not been made to work. 110. Many vegetable farmers carry their products to market in sacks and boxes utilizing the autobuses that travel the main roads. Pictured is a bus with vegetables and other crops loaded on top going to Merida. The products on top belonged to nine different farmers all of whom were inside the bus taking a full day to market their small lots of products. 111. The Panamerican Highway, is the western part of VE, has been constructed at the very root of the Andes. It runs along through the low lands which extend from the mountains towards the Lake of Maracaibo. This modern highway will reduce to almost half the time required to travel from many Andean zones to Maracaibo, Barquisimeto or Caracas. The above photo shows one of the solid bridges which were being constructed over the numerous rivers this road must cross. 112. If it is difficult to construct and maintain roads in the mountain area of the Andes, their construction at the foot of these mountains is also complicated. Numerous rivers, many of them very wide, flow from the mountain range and in the rainy season they swell and become very dangerous. The construction of the Panamerican Highway on the northern part of the Andes has to face these problems. Here, at the south end of the VE Andes, we see a bridge over the Chururu River which was destroyed by a flood. 113. Until some 30 years ago roads had not penetrated the Andes. The mule and the horse were since the Conquest the only fast means of transportation available. The traveler needed then nearly a full week to cross the Andes from one end to the other. 114. The Transandean highway was constructed over 20 years ago and has been considerably improved during recent years. However, because of the rough terrain of the area there are still many switchbacks and steep grades as pictured here which, are a trial to travelers, especially to truck drivers who continually pass over this road. 115. The high altitude wheat growing area around Apartaderos in Merida is characterized by the very limited bush and tree vegetation and the solid stone walls built with rocks as they were cleared from the fields. Wheat has been grown in many of these areas for almost 400 years and the rock and pressed earth wall construction of the houses in the area give an impression of permanence achieved through hard work by the people residing there. The darker colored patches in the photograph are potato fields. 116. The boundary line between the states of Trujillo and Merida as it exists today in the Motatan River valley just above the town of La Mesa de Renujaque shown here was set long before the present state areas were established. It was in 1559 that Maldonado leading the expedition for the province of Nueva Granada and Captain Francisco Ruiz representing the old province of VE met in the area shown in the photograph. The point at which they met was agreed upon was a dividing line between the two old provinces and it was reestablished as the boundary between Trujillo and Merida in 1899. 117. Valera is one of the more recent cities founded in the Andes but it has grown rapidly and is now one of the three largest cities in the region. It was founded in 1817 and is now the largest market and service area for Turjillo. The photograph shows the city as it is located at the junction of the Motatan and Momboy Rivers which then flow on into Lake Maracaibo. 118. Production of annual crops are carried on even on steep slopes in the Andes without use of soil protecting practices. In spite of this some areas, as that shown in the photograph for valley above Bailadores in Merida have continued with this type of production, but with generally reducing yields for many years. 119. During the glacial periods of the Pleistocene the summits of the VE Andes were covered by glaciers. The sharp peaks, the extensive rock surfaces, the lakes, the U-shaped valley, the moraines and the erratic material that we observe today in the paramos are the products of this old glacial activity. As we can see in this photo of Pico Bolivar, such activity has been beneficial because of the great beauty it has given to the Andean landscape. 120. In the western part of Tachira the Andes suddenly lose their extremely abrupt topography to become a region of low mountains which rarely rise above 2,000 meters. Known as the "depression de Tachira" this densely populated zone is characterized by softer relief and gentler slopes then most of the Andean region. 121. The great longitudinal valleys of the Andes are one of the major characteristics of the region. The Momboy valley, seen in the photo above, runs in a straight line parallel to the Motatan valley, directed toward Valera. Its bottom is quite flat and has a fertile soil which is almost entirely occupied by sugar cane. La Puerta and Mendoza Fria are the only two and ancient towns which exist in this picturesque valley. 122. The Caparo River, which serves as boundary between the states of Barinas, Merida, and Tachira, receives the waters of an extensive region at the southeastern part of Merida. The Aricagua, Mucupati, Mucuchachi, Guaimaral, and Camburito Rivers are the largest tributaries which feed the Caparo river in the Andes before it slides slowly through the Llanos in search of the Apure. In this photo we see the imposing Caparo River across from Canton, in the extreme southeastern side of Tachira, near the spot where the new highway goes through to Guasdualito. 123. The Upper Chama Valley is flanked by the "Sierra Nevada" on the south and the "Sierra del Norte" on the north. These two ridges rise with crests over 4,000 meters whose serrated peaks sprout from the "paramo" among hundred of lakes. Here we see, at the foot of the Sierra Nevada, the town of Apartaderos, at 3,310 meters altitude, whose population is chiefly dedicated to planting wheat and potatoes. 124. The Chama Valley transforms itself, below Ejido, into a true desert which extends over 30 kilometers as far as Estanques. The very dry climate, the xerophytic vegetation, the extremely eroded and desiccated lands of this part of the Chama Valley are characteristic of what man's activities have originated and the goats have worsened. 125. The Motatan River has its source at the Paramo de Mucuchies and runs through a narrow and straight valley before it leaves the mountains near the city of Valera. Here we note the high valley of the Motatan, in the vicinity of Chachopo and La Venta, where the impetuous waters of the river descend by jumps, while alongside it the Transandean Highway rises slowly towards the "Paso del Aguila". 126. The Andes present great contrast in climate and vegetation, not only vertically but also horizontally. In the midst of this humid area, suddenly appear dry and very dry valleys whose scarce xerophytic vegetation contrasts with the dense tropical forests found in the vicinity. Such arid islands appear generally because the winds from the Lake of Maracaibo and the Llanos lost their humidity as they pass the first mountains and as they reach these valleys they cannot produce rain and, besides, may have a drying effect. It can be estimated that valleys of this type have a dry season of about 7 months or more. 127. The flat and gently sloping lands are very scarce in the Andes. They are usually found at the bottom of longitudinal valleys, in the vegas, terraces, and alluvial fans. The upper Chama Valley that we see in this photograph is one of the few Andean valleys that have an extensive gently sloping bottom. 128. San Cristobal, seen in this photo, was founded in the year 1561. After three centuries of existence this colonial city was still not bigger than a town of 3,000 inhabitants: less important in Tachira than La Grita and Lobatera. Its commercial and industrial development, accelerated by the construction of railroads, and especially by the Transandean highway, caused and continue to cause rapid growth of the population of the capital of Tachira. San Cristobal, in 1950, had 56,073 inhabitants, having by then reached the category of the most important urban center of the Andean region. 129. The humid tropical forests of the Andes extend chiefly through the piedmont and lower valleys of the north and southwestern part of the region. The humid, westerly winds from the plains, strike the mountains in these parts and are forced upward where condensation occurs and heavy rainfalls are frequent. The annual rainfall in these zones varies between 2,000 and 4,000 mm, but the rains are interrupted almost completely during the three-month dry season. The palm trees (Maximiliana sp.) are the clearest indication of these wet tropical forest formations which are made up of more than 100 species in the better soil areas. 130. From the ancient and extensive alluvial terraces of Santo Domingo, in the southeastern part of Tachira, there is a beautiful panoramic view over the Uribante plains which unfolds at the foot of the Andes. Further down from Santo Domingo there plains are still almost totally covered by the San Camilo forest, which extends towards the east for more then 80Kms before it makes way for the savannahs of Barinas and Apure. 131. Manufacture of ceramics is still a part of home industry. 132. A cash economy brings with it the beginning of a laboring class in the Andes. 133. The Bocono valley has a humid, subtropical climate sure to its altitude and position. This climatic factor has had great influence in the development of local coffee industry which makes the place one of the most important coffee centers of the Andes. The town of Bocono is found within this zone. Found in 1763, Bocono, shown in this photo, now has a population of 5,600 inhabitants. 134. No caption. 135. Members of a household in the high Andes. 136. Vegetable production is not carried out in large areas in the Andes but constitutes an intensive land use which can utilize the small irregular shaped patches of good soil encountered in valley bottoms in the area. With proper production methods vegetables yield a good return for the high labor expenditure required and the Andean region has some ecological advantages for vegetable crops over many of the lower tropical areas in VE. 137. Cattle production is the preponderant livestock industry in the Andes and other types of livestock have little economic importance now. Pictured is a herd of Llanos cattle which were brought to a farm in Tachira for grass fattening before going to market. 138. Production of bananas and platanos is carried on extensively in the Andes, especially in the tropical valleys at low altitudes leading from the mountains. Loading of platanos in the vicinity of La Fria for shipment to San Cristobal is pictured. 139. The Trans-Andean highway has made the Andes more accessible to the outside world. 140. The extolling of commercial products leads to greater confusions and frustrations. 141. This miller in Chachopo also weaves bindings for alpargatas. 142. Some were sought by Heaven as angelitos. 143.

"Se ganan algunas lochas por la familia". 152. Old stone wheel coffee mills for thrashing coffee which has been dried with the pulp on are used in many areas where "parapara" coffee is still produced.

The poster lists CBR's patrons; under the Venezuelan government, there are the Ministry of Agriculture (MAC); the National Agrarian Institute (IAN); the Banco Agricola (BAP); and under the American International Association, Shell, Creole, Mene Grande, International and Socony oil companies. Under programs, it mentions 1) supervised credit; 2) agricultural extension; 3) home economics; 4) special studies; 5) agricultural training. Under objectives, it lists 1) improvement of the standard of living; training and education; 3) increase in agricultural production. 217.

The twenty nurses aides enrolled in the four-week home improvement course, offered by home economists of CBR in Maracay, demonstrate some of their projects. In the clothing course they learned to adapt available materials (feed sacks etc.) to family needs and, in due course, will instruct rural housewives to do the same. Bits of scrap lumber and tin cans, brightly-painted, make effective playthings for small children. Even the most rudimentary cupboard or container, if screened and covered, is superior to the widespread rural practice of leaving foods about in open vessels, often placed on the floor. 224.

This Guarico farmer is clearing the sperture into the "bacaquero" (ant hill) in preparation for filling it with the chlorodane spray. Such any hills are found frequently in corn fields near Calabozo. 2. This Guarico farmer applies the spray directly into the opening of the ant hill, thereby effectively eliminating a large number of the destructive red ants which infest his corn field near Calabozo. 3. This Guarico farmer applies the spray directly into the opening of the ant hill, thereby effectively eliminating a large number of the destructive red ants which infest his corn field near Calabozo. 4. A Ministry of Agriculture demonstrator sets out for a Guarico corn field with a can of chlorodane spray packed on his back. His job is to show farmers of the Calabozo area in Guarico how to spray the bachacos (red ants) which attack their crops. 5. This farmer had bought a supply if insecticide from the Guarico office of Banco Agricola &amp; Pecuaria in Calabozo and is paying for his purchase. 6. Farmers attending the course in operation of equipment offered by CBR technicians in Guarico learn to care for the expensive machines they handle. 7. This Guarico farmer has drenched the "bachaqueros" (ant hills) inhabited by the destructive VE red ants; now he is dousing the "roads" which they have built from the ant hills to the corn plants. 8. The famous VE bachacos (red ants) destroyed one-tenth of this corn crop on a farm near Calabozo in Guarico. 9. A pair of bachacos are having themselves a feast on this corn leaf in a field near Calabozo. 10. Here the camera of Paul Meyn has penetrated the privacy of a bachaco road, leading from the any hill to the corn field on a farm near Calabozo, state of Guarico. 12. Those VE bachacos have a formidable appetite. Look at what they have done to a tree trunk on a farm near Calabozo, Guarico. 13. This is the bachaquero where a large community of the marauding red ants of Guarico have established headquarters. This shot was taken on a farm near Calabozo. This indicates just how large the bachaqueros really are. The photo was taken on a farm near Calabozo. 14. Here is a queen bachaco leaving the nest to celebrate her nuptials. This photo was taken on a farm near Calabozo. 15. This shows just how large the bachaco queen is. She still had her wings which she will lose shortly after breeding. The photo was taken on a farm near Calabozo. 16. Here is a male bachaco of the class dedicated to breeding. The photo was taken on a farm near Calabozo. 17. Here is a male breeder and two "soldier" bachacos. The former is a dilettante, and the latter do the work. 18. Here is a sampling of the entire bachacos family: in the foreground is an unbred queen - she still has her wings; behind her is her more experiences, wingless sister; the second winged apt is the breeding male; beside him is a dead, wingless male; the largest ant is a "soldier", and the two small ants are "slaves". The photo was taken on a farm near Calabozo, Guarico. 19. The regional branches of Banco Agricola y Pecuaria (Farmers and Stockmen's Bank) stock insecticides for exterminating the bachaco. Here an agent is discussing the product with a prospective buyer in Calabozo. 20. This farmer has bought a supply of insecticide from the Guarico office of Banco Agricola y Pecuaria in Calabozo and is paying for his purchase. 21. The chlorodane liquid is shot directly into the "bachaquero", headquarters of a marauding band of red ants which attack the corn fields in the region of Calabozo. 22. In addition to spraying directly into the opening of the ant hill, it was recommended to the farmers that they also spray the area around each "bachaquero", as the farmer is shown doing here in his corn field near Calabozo. 23. Another chlorodane bath is given the bachacos which infest the corn fields near Calabozo. 24. Guarico farm worker sign up for the course in the operation of farm equipment at the office of the Ministry of Agriculture veterinarian in Calabozo. 25.

This is a field in the state of Guarico during the rainy season. In the dry season, this same field is parched and cracked. To eliminate such extremes, the VE government is building the giant Guarico dam. 34. This is a typical field near Calabozo. The big Guarico River dam, which the VE government now is constructing will provide a reservoir for collecting such water as run-off and will store it until the subsequent dry season, when such fields as the one shown become parched and cracked from lack of moisture. 35. This is a Guarico rice field. 36. Heavy rains have caused extensive erosion in this Guarico field. 37. This corn field has suffered greatly from an infestation of the army worm. 38. Considerable stirring is necessary to mix the chlorodane powder with water to be used as a spray against the ravenous bachacos which infest the corn fields of Guarico. 39. If a mechanical sprayer is unobtainable, the Guarico farmer can resort to a good-sized tin can with holes punched in the bottom. Such an improvised sprayer is demonstrated by this farmer in ridding his corn field near Calabozo of the destructive "bachacos". 40. Here the farmer is preparing chlorodane mixture for spraying his field against the bachaco. The photo was taken at a farm home near Calabozo in Guarico. 41. This Guarico farmer now has a diploma which states that he is qualified to operate a tractor and the various attachments used with it. He was among the first group to complete the farm equipment operation course offered by CBR technicians for the Ministry of Agriculture. 42.

Workmen are careful to see that the test project at "el Papelon" dairy farm in Lara is prepared properly. 15. This grader raises a lot of dust as it planes down the trench silo built at "El Papelon" dairy farm in Lara as a demonstration of how to beat the seasonal food shortage which causes sharp fluctuation in milk production of that key area. 16. Sudan grass grows high during the rainy season in the Torres district of Lara, and diary production is double that of the preceding dry season. CBR hopes to help stabilize the situation by storing some of this verdant forage in trench silos. 17. Cows munch forage in the modern stable at the "el Papelon" dairy in the Torres district of Lara, one of VE's key dairy-producing regions. 18.

Both Kimball and Moure are from Florida. 4. Venezuelan youngster grasps new safeguard for his health. The sanitary paper milk carton, introduced to VE by INLACA, is automatically sealed with paraffin, protecting children against the practice of dilution of milk in interval between plant and consumer. By lending technical assistance to dairy farmers, providing them with a steady, year-round market for their produce, and setting up an effective milk distribution system, INLACA is attempting to increase milk production and consumption in VE, thus bringing larger quantities of this basic food into the diets of the people and lowering infant mortality rates. 5. As part of Nutrition Week in the state of Carabobo, the Superintendent of Education, district supervisors and the CIDEA representative in Carabobo carried out programs relative to Nutrition Education.

Manager of PACA in charge of agronomy, has his curiosity aroused by the results of the test plot of Egyptian wheat grown on the company's Chrigua Farms. One thousand pounds of seed (for future planting) came off the half-acre area. Besides this unusually high production, Watson pointed out, the crop reached maturity in 68 days, three weeks earlier than in the southern US. Egyptian wheat will be used chiefly for poultry feed on Chirgua. Expert Watson comes from Dallas, Texas, and has twenty-one years experience with the US government, first as the County Agricultural Agent in Dawson County, Texas, and later as Texas State Director of the Farm Security Administration. He joined VBEC on its tropical food production venture last year. 131. Chirgua Farm manager, C.O. Gingrass, digs up and shows off the first test crop of Hawaiian peanuts ready for harvest on the PACA farm. The 1/8 acre test plot produced an unusually high quantity of large peanuts, many of which contained four kernels instead of two. Five to ten acres will now be planted in Hawaiian peanuts for use as hog pastures. Gingrass, who comes from Edinburg, Texas, has been working and experimenting in tropical agriculture for over 20 years with the US Dept. of Entomology and Plant Quarantine and later with the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs. "I'm a farming pioneer," says Gingrass, "and Latin American agriculture offers new frontiers to a farmer who is interested in experimentation, modernization of agriculture, and --- hard work." 132. Gingrass looks over an experimental crop of Dwarf Hegari, a grain sorghum to be utilized as feed for the company's poultry and livestock programs. Gingrass has worked in tropical agriculture since 1927 when he entered the US Dept. of Entomology and Plant Quarantine.
