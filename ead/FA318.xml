    <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
<p>The central figure in the creation and operation of the Standard Oil Company during its rise to the top of the petroleum industry, John D. Rockefeller (JDR) established for the family a leading role in business and philanthropy. From the days of his earliest employment, Rockefeller, a devout Baptist, was generous in his giving to worthy causes, especially those of a religious nature. During the 1890s he developed an orderly system of philanthropic giving through an office staff that included his close advisor, Frederick T. Gates (1853-1929) and his son, John D. Rockefeller, Jr. (1874-1960). With the advise of these and other associates, Rockefeller established the University of Chicago, The Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research (now The Rockefeller University), the Rockefeller Foundation, and other philanthropic organizations working nationally and internationally in the fields of education, religion, and health. Rockefeller's total donations to philanthropic endeavors are estimated to have been $540 million.</p><p>John D. Rockefeller, Jr. (JDR Jr.) joined his father's office on October 1, 1897. He oversaw the expansion and diversification of the philanthropic work begun by his father. During his lifetime, the younger Rockefeller gave more than $537 million to educational, religious, cultural, medical, and other charitable projects.</p><p>John D. Rockefeller, Jr. and his wife, Abby Aldrich Rockefeller (1874-1948), passed the Rockefeller philanthropic impulse on to their children. Abby (1903-1976), John D. 3rd (1906-1978), Nelson A. (1908-1979), Laurance S. (1910-2004), Winthrop (1912-1973), and David (1915-2017) further expanded and diversified Rockefeller influence and interests, establishing their own philanthropic organizations, most notably the Rockefeller Brothers Fund (1940), and becoming more active politically.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
<p>The Homes series documents the management of four of John D. Rockefeller, Sr.'s and John D. Rockefeller, Jr.'s estates and their New York City homes. The estates are Ormond Beach, Florida; Lakewood, New Jersey; Pocantico Hills, New York; and Seal Harbor, Maine. The New York City homes are 4, 10, and 12 West 54th Street and the apartment at 740 Park Avenue. There is also information regarding John D. Rockefeller 3rd's apartment at One Beekman Place. Most of the material deals with property purchases, employees, the construction of homes, out buildings, and private roads, relations with neighbors and local communities, the contents of the houses (particularly art collections), and the general maintenance and operation of the various homes. The correspondence is between members of the family and the family office on the one hand, and estate managers, employees, contractors, real estate agents, neighbors, members of the various communities, and art dealers on the other.</p><p>The Homes series is divided into twelve sections, nine concern the homes listed above, and three others concern Richford; Transfer of Property; and House Books. The Richford section contains information on the purchase of the site of John D. Rockefeller, Sr.'s birthplace and surrounding property in the 1920s to prevent its commercial exploitation. The Transfer of Property section concerns the transfer of ownership of the various estates from John D. Rockefeller, Sr. to his son John D. Rockefeller, Jr. and the distribution of John D. Rockefeller, Sr.'s personal effects after his death. The House Books are listings and descriptions of the contents of the various houses. These lists also include the contents of Bassett Hall at Williamsburg, Virginia, and John D. Rockefeller, Jr.'s office at Room 5600. Also included in these books are distributions of the personal effects of John D. Rockefeller, Jr., Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, and Martha Baird Rockefeller after their respective deaths.</p><p>Aside from offering an insight into the management of the family estates and homes, this series also illustrates John D. Rockefeller, Jr.'s personal interests in the conservation of land and wildlife and in collecting Chinese porcelains and other art objects. The series also gives many examples of the attention he gave to the details in every affair he handled.</p><p>The collection measures 98 cubic feet. The material covers the years 1885-1961, and the family members who figure prominently in the papers are John D. Rockefeller, Jr. and John D. Rockefeller 3rd. John D. Rockefeller, Sr., Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, Nelson A. Rockefeller, Winthrop Rockefeller, Laurance S. Rockefeller, and David Rockefeller also appear. Of the Rockefeller family advisors who appear, Robert W. Gumbel and Charles O. Heydt are the most prominent.</p>  </scopecontent>
