      <p>Edwin Embree (1883-1950) was born in Osceola, Nebraska, and lived as a youth in Colorado, Wyoming and Kentucky.  He graduated from Yale University in 1906 with a B.A. and then joined the staff of the New York Sun as a cub reporter assigned to police stations and theaters.  In 1907 he accepted a position as assistant editor of the Yale Alumni Weekly and remained at Yale in a variety of administrative capacities until 1917.  While at New Haven he continued his studies in philosophy and education and received an M.A. in 1913.</p>
      <p>In 1917 Mr. Embree joined The Rockefeller Foundation as Secretary under George E. Vincent. Interested in interracial relations, race development, human biology, and cultural anthropology, Embree became Director of the newly created Division of Studies in 1925, and developed some of these interests. He remained in that position until 1927 when he filled the position of Vice President of the Foundation.</p>
      <p>Pursuing his interests in interracial relations in 1927, Embree became Director of the Rosenwald Fund, a group which made appropriations to agencies working in the area of Negro welfare. After the depression the Fund concentrated on research and planning in connection with farm tenant problems. Several articles were written as a result of these studies which led to Federal legislation and the establishment of the Farm Security Administration. Having expended its resources, the Rosenwald Fund terminated in 1948. Embree then became President of the Liberian Foundation, a joint American-Liberian organization which assisted in the advancement of health, welfare and education in that country.</p>
      <p>Mr. Embree was the author of "Brown America, the story of a New Race," 1931; "Prospecting for Heaven," 1932; "American Negroes: A Handbook," 1932; "Indians of the Americas," 1939; "Brown Americans: the Story of a Tenth of the Nation," 1943; "Thirteen Against the Odds," 1944; and co-author of "Human Biology and Race Welfare," 1930.</p>
