    <abstract id="c7a0223ef5ed739dac40ff694ce77749">Robert H. (Hazard) Edwards joined the Ford Foundation as a program officer for the International Division in 1965. In 1968, Mr. Edwards served as the Foundation's Representative in Pakistan. He later transferred to the Middle East and Africa (MEA) Program in the early 1970s where he would serve as Deputy Head under William Fredericks. In 1973, he succeeded Fredericks as MEA Head. Mr. Edwards left the Foundation in 1977 to accept an appointment as President of Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota. The Office Files of Robert H. Edwards span from 1968 to 1977 and comprise the files that Mr. Edwards kept as Head of the International Division's MEA Program. The collection is organized into three series: program management files, subject files, and chronological files. The program management files primarily consist of memoranda but also correspondence, notes, reports, and papers relating to the work of Mr. Edwards's program officer Lowell S. Hardin. Mr. Edwards's subject files contain memoranda, correspondence, papers, speeches, reports, meeting materials, and background primarily pertaining to the Foundation's programs in the Middle East and Africa. His chronological files of correspondence and memoranda from the year 1968 and the years between 1972 and 1977 are also available.</abstract>

<p>The Ford Foundation was chartered by Henry and Edsel Ford in 1936 "to receive and administer funds for scientific, educational and charitable purposes, all for the public welfare", and initially served the Ford family's charitable interests in the Detroit area. Following the deaths of Edsel Ford (1943) and Henry Ford (1947), the Foundation was propelled to the forefront of philanthropy as the largest American foundation in terms of both endowment and yearly expenditures, and with an international scope to its major program areas.</p><p>
During the Foundation's first twenty years its major programs were in international economic development, primary and higher education, educational and public broadcasting, behavioral sciences, civil liberties, urban development, fine arts and the humanities. The Ford Foundation also partnered with the Rockefeller Foundation in supporting agricultural development in South America, Africa, and Southeast Asia. Since the 1970s, the Foundation has also pioneered programs in women's rights, energy policy, micro-financing in under-developed countries, establishing human rights groups, and improving international HIV/AIDS education.</p>  </bioghist>

<p>Robert H. (Hazard) Edwards was born on May 26, 1935 in London, England and was raised in Middleton, Ohio. In 1957, he received a B.A. in English from Princeton University. He subsequently read law at Cambridge University and received an LL.B. from Harvard Law School in 1961.</p><p>
After graduation, Mr. Edwards served under the Queen's Commissioner in the Bechuanaland Protectorate from 1961 to 1963, where he assisted in its transition to independence as the Republic of Botswana. From 1963 to 1965, he worked for the U.S. State Department's Bureau of United Nations Affairs on matters relating to the newly independent African countries before joining the Ford Foundation as a program officer for the International Division in 1965. In 1968, Mr. Edwards served as the Foundation's Representative in Pakistan. He later transferred to the Middle East and Africa (MEA) Program in the early 1970s where he would serve as Deputy Head under William Fredericks. In 1973, he succeeded Fredericks as MEA Head.</p><p>
Mr. Edwards left the Foundation in 1977 to accept an appointment as President of Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota. In 1986, he left Carleton College to join the Secretariat of His Highness the Aga Khan as Head of the Department of Health, Education and Housing in Karachi, Pakistan. From 1987 to 1990, he also served on the Board of Trustees of Aga Khan University. He returned to the United States in 1990, serving as President of Bowdoin College until his retirement in 2001.</p>  </bioghist>

<p>The Ford Foundation has been engaged in overseas work since the early 1950s. The Foundation's aspiration to become a national and international philanthropy for the advancement of human welfare was first formally expressed in the seminal 1949 report of the Gaither Study Committee, which was commissioned by the Board of Trustees to chart the future. In 1951, the Foundation established two of its first grant programs, Overseas Development (OD) and Overseas Training and Research (OTR). The granting goals were to increase agricultural production, improve health and living conditions, and advance education. South and Southeast Asia were the initial focus, with India and Pakistan receiving the majority of grants. A more limited number of grants were issued in Indonesia and Burma. A program for smaller regional and national grants also was initiated for the Near East. In 1957, Overseas Development further expanded to include programs in Latin America.</p><p>As part of a Foundation reorganization in 1966, the Overseas Development Program, along with other international programs such as International Training and Research (ITR) and Population, became part of a single International Division (ID). A subsequent restructuring of the International Division occurred in 1980-1981 and led to the creation of the Developing Countries Program (DCP). DCP was again restructured in 1989, resulting in the separating of programs in Africa and the Middle East (AME, formerly MEA), Asia (ASIA), Latin American and the Caribbean (LAC/OLAC), Human Rights and Governance (HRG), Education and Culture (EC), Program-Related Investments (PRI), and International Affairs (IA) as independent program areas.</p>  </bioghist>

<p><emph render="bold">Segment 1: International Activities of the Ford Foundation: An Overview</emph></p> 

<p>The Foundation's aspiration to become a national and international philanthropy for the advancement of human welfare was first formally expressed in the seminal 1949 report of the Gaither Study Committee, <emph render="italic">Report of the Study for the Ford Foundation on Policy and Program</emph> (RAC Library, call letters 361.7 GAI ), which was commissioned by the Board of Trustees to chart the Foundation's future. Foundation Trustees launched Ford's international grantmaking activities in 1950 when they approved the committee's report and its embrace of peace, democracy, and freedom.  Since then, the Foundation has tackled these goals using a variety of strategies and responding to changing contexts, from the Cold War to the 1989 fall of the Berlin Wall and beyond.</p>

<p>Toward the Foundation's aspiration‎al goal, "the establishment of peace", its international activities have comprised a wide range of conceptual approaches and focus areas. These include international affairs, international studies, international understanding, arms control and disarmament, international law, international economic concerns, and overseas development in nearly every region of the world. Three distinct periods emerge for the international grantmaking defined by external contextual changes and internal changes in Foundation leadership and structures: the expansion era of 1950-1965; the transition and restructuring years of 1966-1988; and the post-1989 shift away from Cold War dichotomies.  During each of the distinct historical periods the consistent objectives were: 1) to ensure freedom and democracy in developed countries; 2) to foster education and international understanding in all countries; and 3) to contribute to the social, economic, and political development of less developed countries.</p>

<p><emph render="bold">Segment 3. Period Summary - Transition and Restructuring 1966-1988</emph></p>
<p>During this era, the Foundation's earlier interest in business and the economy evolved into a commitment to improving conditions for people living on the margins of society. The Ford Foundation promoted advancements in women's rights around the globe and introduced micro-lending into grantmaking. At the same time, the economic issues that were shaping program strategies also affected the Foundation's assets. Severe cuts resulted in a significant restructuring of country programs and reduced budgets across all programs. </p>

<p>Even with the cuts in country offices, in the 1970s Ford grantees in developing countries received approximately 80% of the International Division budget. The remaining fifth went to Population, Development Studies, and International Affairs. Although representing a much smaller piece, the International Security and Arms Control program from 1973 was the Foundation's most concerted effort to make meaningful inroads in disarmament and nuclear issues - those challenges most directly linked to the Foundation's historic concern for peace. By 1979, the Ford Foundation was the biggest funder of arms control as a field, both in the U.S. and overseas. </p>

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The Office Files of Robert H. Edwards span from 1968 to 1977 and comprises the files that Mr. Edwards kept as Head of the International Division's Middle East and Africa Program. The collection is organized into three series: program management files, subject files, and chronological files.</p><p>
The program management files primarily consist of memoranda but also correspondence, notes, reports and papers relating to the work of Mr. Edwards's program officer Lowell S. Hardin. As is reflected in the subjects covered in his files, Mr. Hardin's work primarily concerned agricultural research and rural development in the Middle East and Africa. His files include information on agricultural research centers, international efforts in aquaculture, the world food crisis, the difficulty in recruiting staff for Africa, the phasing out of advisory support for economic planning in Africa, and the possibility of Saudi support for agricultural research.</p><p>
Mr. Edwards's subject files contain memoranda, correspondence, papers, speeches, reports, meeting materials and background primarily pertaining to the Foundation's programs in the Middle East and Africa. There are materials on the Foundation interest in and support for inter-faith dialogues in the Middle East, area studies and social science research in Africa, training for journalists in Africa, and international agricultural research and training centers. In addition, there are discussion and background papers as well as memoranda concerning the agenda and logistics for the Ford Foundation Seminar for OLAC/MEA Program Advisors in Agriculture held in Ibadan, Nigeria (1973). Some of the subject files pertain to the Foundation's work on legal development in Latin America and the International Legal Center (ILC) Research Advisory Committee on Law and Development. These files contain meeting materials for the ILC Research Advisory Committee and memoranda reporting on a series of in-house Foundation meetings on law and social change in Latin America (1972-1973).</p><p>
A subject file on Foundation-grantee relations contains memoranda and discussion papers critiquing and reflecting on the how the Foundation interacts with grantees. Memoranda and papers address such issues as defining the limits of Foundation intervention in grantee organizations, the autonomy granted to grantees to execute projects, the responsibilities of program officers, and the status of Foundation employees hired through suballocations. These materials appear to be background for task force discussions addressing a lack of sensitivity toward grantees in Foundation policy formulation (1973).</p><p>
The chronological files in the collection were expanded by the addition of a later segment of Robert H. Edwards office files (Accession 2019:019). They contain correspondence and memoranda. </p>  </scopecontent>

consists of Robert H. Edward's chronological files of correspondence and memoranda. When the collection was first processed, it only contained the April to October 1968 chronological files. These files contain information about meetings with grantees or potential grantees, correspondence with grantees, grant recommendations, and some budget information.</p><p>
A later run of Edwards' chronological files was incorporated into the series when another segment of Edwards' office files was transferred to the RAC from the Ford Foundation. These files primarily originate from between 1972 and 1977 and document Edwards' time as Deputy Head and Head of the Foundation's Middle East and Africa (MEA) Program. The correspondence and memoranda in the files concern the MEA's grant giving activities in the fields of agricultural development, economic development, education, race relations, and international relations in different countries throughout the Middle East and Africa. Administrative tasks such as setting up visits to the different MEA field offices, tracking data related to different grants, and managing the MEA budget are also documented in the records. </p><p>
Program shifts in MEA organizational structure and grant giving activities due to and international political developments and budget constraints are discussed in much of Edwards' correspondence. Some materials in the Summer 1976 chronological files concern the transfer of the Middle East Regional Office headquarters from Beirut, Lebanon to Cairo, Egypt and the scaling back of the Foundation's programming in Lebanon following the recent changes in that country. Similarly, there are records in chronological files from the Spring of 1977 that regard the closing of a Foundation suboffice in Saudi Arabia as well as concerns of whether or not long-term involvement in the country would be practical. In regards to the impact of budget changes on MEA programming, there are many letters throughout the files that discuss the MEA's attempts to reexamine how it should support area studies for the Middle East and Africa. </p><p>
A less featured aspect of MEA programming featured in Edwards' chronological files is the support of African literary projects. The series holds several letters that Edwards addressed to Nigerian author, Chinua Achebe. Other subjects that Edwards' correspondence and memoranda discuss include events in Pakistan and Bangladesh in the early 1970s (Edwards was Representative for Pakistan before transferring to MEA), Arab-Israeli relations, and the development of programming for Southern Africa. While many of the documents in Edwards' later chronological files regard his departure, there is also some significant memoranda such as his memo about program directions for South Africa.</p></scopecontent><processinfo id="9807354cfef2dc0c9797833404dd910c"><head>Processing Information</head><p>The 1972-1977 chronological files were processed into the series at a later date.
