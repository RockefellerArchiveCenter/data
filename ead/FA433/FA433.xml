    <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
<p>Laurance Spelman Rockefeller was born on May 26, 1910, in New York City, the fourth of the six children of John D. Rockefeller, Jr. and Abby Aldrich Rockefeller. He attended Lincoln School, a progressive coeducational preparatory school connected with Teachers College of Columbia University in New York City, before entering Princeton in 1928. A philosophy major, he graduated from Princeton in 1932 with a B.A. degree in philosophy and went on to two years of graduate study at Harvard Law School.</p><p>On August 15, 1934, Laurance Rockefeller married Mary French in the Congregational Church in Woodstock, Vermont. Together they raised three daughters and a son.</p><p>During World War II, Laurance Rockefeller served in the Navy (1942-1945), attaining the rank of lieutenant commander.</p><p>Laurance Rockefeller pursued a number of successful careers during his lifetime. He was a pioneer in the field of venture capital. He was a leading and influential figure for three decades in the American conservation movement. He led the development of one of the world's foremost cancer care and research facilities, and was both a benefactor and advisor to major educational institutions. And, with great foresight, he combined his personal vision for conservation, recreation, and the spiritual needs of individuals to develop internationally acclaimed environmentally oriented resorts. His many accomplishments have been recognized both nationally and internationally.</p><p>In 1935, he began working in the family office in Rockefeller Center. His first duties were to develop his knowledge and understanding of Rockefeller philanthropic activities, conservation projects, and business interests, through both study and playing a modest role in their operation. Simultaneously, he developed his own special interest, blending business acumen with the talents of a "gadgeteer," a label he once pinned on himself.</p><p>He became well known as an investor of risk capital in young enterprises whose future was based primarily on scientific and technological developments. Over the years his investment interests included the fields of aviation, aerospace, electronics, high temperature physics, composite materials, optics, lasers, data processing, thermionics, instrumentation, and nuclear power. Beginning in August 1969, his venture capital investments in these areas were made through a venture capital group, Venrock, formed by members of the Rockefeller family.</p><p>In a different area of venture capital, he developed outstanding environmentally oriented resort hotels in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Hawaii, and Vermont, serving as chairman of Rockresorts, Inc., a resort management company which he founded and chaired.</p><p>Conservation of the environment and recreational development constituted much of Laurance Rockefeller's philanthropy and public service. His introduction to public service came in 1939 when Governor Herbert H. Lehman of New York appointed him to the Palisades Interstate Park Commission (PIPC). He was president of the PIPC from 1970 to 1977 and continued as a commissioner until his resignation in December 1978. He was an advisor to Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, and Ford on matters of environmental conservation and outdoor recreation, and he worked on federal commissions set up to help develop national conservation and environmental policies and programs. In 1958, President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed him chairman of the Outdoor Recreation Resources Review Commission (ORRRC), which charted ways of meeting the nation's outdoor recreation needs through the year 2000. He was a special emissary for President Lyndon Johnson in the effort that led to creation of the National Redwoods Park in California, and he served as chairman of President Nixon's Citizens' Advisory Committee on Environmental Quality, successor to a similar group which he headed under President Johnson. He played a pivotal role in the creation and development of several national parks including Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming, Virgin Islands National Park on the island of St. John, and Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historical Park in Vermont.</p><p>He served as a leader of several important nonprofit and philanthropic organizations. He was president and later chairman of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund (1958-1980) and was a trustee of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation (1960-1982). His first association with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City was in 1947; he also served as chairman (1960-1982), overseeing an expansion and modernization of its operations. He was a longtime trustee of the New York Zoological Society (1935-1986) and served as its president (1969-1971) and chairman (1971-1985).</p><p>Laurance Rockefeller received many honors for his efforts on behalf of the environment and cancer research and treatment. Among them are the Alfred P. Sloan, Jr. Memorial Award from the American Cancer Society (1969), the Medal of Freedom (1969), Commander (Honorary) of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (1971), the Woodrow Wilson Award from Princeton University (1991), the Congressional Gold Medal (1991), the Chairman's Award from the National Geographic Society (1995), the Theodore Roosevelt National Park Medal of Honor (1995), and the Lady Bird Johnson Conservation Award for Lifetime Achievement (1997). In 2003, he became the first person to be made an honorary citizen of the British Virgin Islands in recognition of his many contributions to the area. In December 1959 he received the National Institute of Social Sciences' Gold Medal for distinguished services to humanity, an award previously bestowed upon his grandfather and father. This was the first time in the Institute's history that three generations of a family had been so honored. The citation to Laurance Rockefeller proclaimed him as a "creative organizer of ventures into new fields of human endeavor for the growing aspirations of mankind; [and a] leader in the conservation of natural resources and in the development of the medical and social sciences for the welfare of the individual." In 1967, the National Institute awarded Gold Medals to all five Rockefeller brothers in recognition of their individual and collective services to humanity.</p><p>Laurance Rockefeller died on July 11, 2004, at his home in Manhattan.</p><p>Prepared by Rockefeller Family and Associates, June 1982, and 2004.</p>  </bioghist>

Arrangement within files is generally chronological, though occasionally an alphabetical series of documents will follow the chronological series. The family office normally sorted documents in reverse chronological order. We have generally undone this reverse order and have arranged records within a folder from the earliest date to the latest. The family office also commonly created smaller groupings of records (around a topic or individual) within a general chronological file. These groupings consequently form sorts of chronological (and subject) balloons within the regular order of the file. Documents within a grouping may span several years, but the date of the last item determines the placement of the documents within the file. In some cases we have used paper folders or inserted blank sheets of paper to mark the interruptions or distinctions.</p></arrangement><otherfindaid id="aspace_bf201c42c16057fa9bada072be128921"><head>Other Finding Aids note</head><p>Dr. Joseph W.

The family office grouped exchanges of correspondence with an individual or around an issue and filed the letters together by date of the latest item, forming small subject or personal categories within the chronological files. When LSR's correspondence with an individual was significant or sustained, we have brought the correspondence together and created a series of individual alphabetical files. The alphabetical listing reflects the volume and distribution of the correspondence more than the prominence of the correspondent. Also, a few individual files (for Rhoda French, Robert Lodge, Randolph Marston, and Leonard Outhwaite) have been moved from Personal Papers to the Correspondence series, and in some cases additional correspondence has been integrated into the files.</p></arrangement><scopecontent id="aspace_7c69be49a0ff87d7120cc54b64149f1f"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>LSR's correspondence files are divided into general and family correspondence, containing both incoming and outgoing correspondence. Replies are generally filed with the correspondence.</p><p>The general Correspondence files contain personal correspondence with friends and relations, as well as some correspondence with associates concerning activities and organizations with which LSR was involved. The bulk of the correspondence dates from around 1935 to 1961; earlier materials in the files, dating from 1919, are about LSR (for example, concerning schooling or camp), rather than being direct correspondence with him. There are some gaps in the correspondence during LSR's college years and during the period of his military service from 1942-1945. (This correspondence is found in a separate personal papers series that never formed part of the OMR files.)</p><p>Significant correspondents include Lincoln School and Princeton friends; friends and associates from LSR's service with the U.S. Navy Bureau of Aeronautics, Eastern Airlines, the New York City Airport Authority, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, and other organizations; cousins and in-laws (Margaret Strong de Cuevas, Madeline Prentice, the French family); and family friends and business associates. LSR's prominence as a Rockefeller and as an innovative investor accounts for some correspondence from acquaintances who wrote with product ideas or seeking references or other support.</p><p>Also in the Correspondence files is a Mail Log of incoming correspondence, which LSR's office maintained starting in 1953. There are two bound ledgers for the period 1953 to July 1961 and one folder for June-December 1961, which record mail received and its disposition. (See RG 3 for the continuation of this series from 1962-1983 and 1986.)</p><p>The Family Correspondence files contain LSR's correspondence with his parents and siblings and with his aunt, Lucy Truman Aldrich. Letters are filed chronologically by correspondent. There is a calendar to the Family Correspondence, which was created by family archivist Joseph W. Ernst. Some family correspondence was moved from the general correspondence files to the respective family folder. Letters from John D. Rockefeller, Jr. prior to 1933 in particular were originally filed with the general correspondence. The file of letters from Abby Aldrich Rockefeller for the period 1920-1933 contains mainly typed copies.</p><p>A set of original letters and telegrams to LSR from his parents Abby Aldrich Rockefeller and John D. Rockefeller, Jr., 1920-1933, was discovered after the OMR files were processed. We have added this correspondence to the collection, but have not attempted to match up the letters or integrate them into the other correspondence files for AAR and JDR Jr. (This set of correspondence was found among the papers of LSR's associate, Fred Smith, who was preparing a biography of LSR; it appears the correspondence was lent to him for copying.) The correspondence includes many of the letters for which there are only typescripts in the original files, and it also includes some letters that are not otherwise represented in the collection.</p><p>LSR's early letters to his family and some correspondence with his siblings during his college years are not found among the OMR files. Similarly, there is no correspondence in this series with his wife, Mary French Rockefeller.</p></scopecontent><c id="fc7c638813ba4ae68c51627a70c7c286"

Other materials include condolence letters LSR received on the deaths of his parents Abby Aldrich Rockefeller and John D. Rockefeller, Jr. A few files concern memorials to AAR and JDR, Jr.</p><p>Significant biographical material includes a draft of an unpublished biography of LSR by his associate Frederik Smith, and LSR's Activity Lists, an annual detailing of his business, philanthropic, and social interests, activities, and memberships, which was compiled for the Rockefeller family office. The Awards file includes awards LSR received from the Belgian Congo, for his conservation work, and for his work on behalf of cancer research and treatment. The Jury Duty file concerns in particular LSR's service in 1953-1954 as foreman of a Special Grand Jury empanelled to investigate waterfront crime.</p><p>Contribution files document LSR's philanthropic contributions for the period 1935 to 1961, and include annual and comprehensive statements of his contributions and giving program. There is also one file detailing LSR's Conservation Benevolences from 1942 to 1963.</p><p>A large proportion of this series concerns LSR's residences in New York City and Pocantico Hills, New York, and his boats. The files on both subjects show something of LSR's early and continuing interest in new technologies. LSR built a steel house on the Rockefeller family's Pocantico Hills estate (the Arcy Corporation failed in the middle of construction, which accounts for the large volume of correspondence). The Pocantico Hills House files (and the Office Furnishings file) also document LSR's interest in furnishings by the Finnish designer Alvar Aalto. The Boats files include correspondence and designs concerning aluminum-hulled boats, a 1941 proposal for concrete barges, and discussions of radios, life vests, and other equipment. Files on the Dauntless concern the yacht LSR used to commute between Tarrytown, New York and his Rockefeller Center office.</p><p>The Aviation Interests files relate to LSR's wartime service with the Production Division of the U.S. Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics and document his continuing personal and business interest in aviation operations and innovation in the postwar years. The files include memoranda and reports on various airline corporations, inspection visits, aviation policy, and corporate offerings.</p><p>LSR assumed his grandfather John D. Rockefeller's seat on the New York Stock Exchange as of August 5, 1937. The Brokerage Business files concern his membership on the exchange and administrative aspects of his business, but also include some materials on stock offerings and investment opportunities.</p><p>The Schools files concern primarily LSR's enrollment and study at Princeton University, and include a copy of his senior thesis and some research notes. There is also a small file concerning his years at Harvard Law School.</p><p>Other files concern Paintings and Works of Art, including a file on paintings of military aviation by Henry Farré, which LSR acquired for the Air Force Academy. The Paintings files and the Trips files help document LSR's friendship with artists Paul Maze and André Dunoyer de Segonzac. The Trips file for the Belgian Congo, 1949, includes LSR's itinerary for the opening of the textile factory, Filtisaf, which he had helped to establish.</p><p>The Personal Papers series presents a very uneven record of LSR's life and activities, particularly for the period up through the mid-1940s. Personal papers in the as yet unprocessed RG 1 document more completely LSR's early education, college years, marriage, naval service, and early interests.</p></scopecontent><c

The series contains a few files relating to LSR's sponsorship of television and film productions, a dossier on negotiations with Howard Hughes in 1954 to purchase the Hughes Tool Company and Aircraft division, and a file containing various proposals for business ventures, but the rest of the series pertains to LSR's involvement in resort development and his creation of the Virgin Islands National Park.</p><p>The variety of files in this series seems to reflect differences in provenance. General geographic files (e.g., Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, St. John) contain miscellaneous correspondence and memoranda on local issues, assorted development proposals, property negotiations, and resort-related issues. Files for Dorado, Puerto Rico and for the Dorado Beach Estates and Hotel concern LSR's negotiations with the property owner Clara Livingston and with Puerto Rican authorities concerning development plans, property purchase, financing, design, and construction of the resort. Files for St. John and the correspondence files (under Virgin Islands) for Frank Stick detail the local intelligence, public relations, and patchwork assembling of property that permitted the creation of the Virgin Islands National Park.</p><p>Public relations files concerning the opening of the Caneel Bay resort and the National Park dedication (December 1, 1956) and the opening of the Dorado Beach Hotel two years later (December 1, 1958) form the largest part of the Business Interests series. In both cases, the opening public relations files concern planning and arrangements for the opening celebrations. Files include multiple drafts of guest lists, letters of invitation, schedules and opening plans, speeches, press releases, and correspondence on transportation and publicity arrangements. The Caneel Bay resort opening coincided with the dedication ceremonies for the Virgin Islands National Park and the public celebration planned for the occasion. An invitational golf tournament capped the inaugural celebrations for the Dorado Beach Hotel resort.</p><p>While LSR pioneered the field of venture capital, there is little in this series that addresses these aspects of his Business Interests. There are a few files in the Personal Papers series that concern LSR's Brokerage Business on the New York Stock Exchange. In the same series Aviation Interests files contain reports and memoranda relating to LSR's business interests in aviation.

Because Memorial and SKI did not merge until 1960, there are separate files for each institution, but the bulk of the records concerns Memorial Hospital. Files addressing common issues or overlapping concerns such as fundraising, general facilities, staff, operations, and organization generally fall under Memorial Hospital. Files concerning the relation with Cornell University are found under SKI and also in the Agreements files under Memorial Hospital.</p></arrangement><scopecontent id="aspace_92697b742303653ab6f614755dafa6cb"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>Records relating to LSR's leadership at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) form the largest series of his OMR files.</p><p>LSR was elected to the Board of Managers of Memorial Hospital for the Treatment of Cancer and Allied Diseases on December 16, 1947, and soon served as assistant treasurer and as a member of the executive, finance, planning, real estate, and Normandy Realty committees. By early 1950, LSR chaired Memorial's executive committee and had been elected a trustee of the Sloan-Kettering Institute. LSR became president of the renamed Memorial Center for Cancer and Allied Diseases in February 1950, and he served in that position until April 1960, when he assumed the chair of the newly consolidated MSKCC.</p><p>The Rockefeller family was an early benefactor of the Memorial Hospital (originally the New York Cancer Hospital, founded in 1884). John D. Rockefeller, Jr. purchased the property on which the hospital stands, and the General Education Board donated $3 million in 1935 for construction of the new building. JDR, Jr. had also funded James Ewing's cancer research, and he made significant pledges in 1948, 1949, and 1954 that added impetus to the administrative reforms and development programs that LSR was spearheading.</p><p>The records in this series underscore Memorial Center's complicated organizational history. Memorial Hospital was the treatment arm of the partnership, providing hospital care and clinical treatment for cancer patients. Memorial's nurses and physicians staffed the James Ewing Hospital, established by the City of New York for the care of indigent patients. It also encompassed the Strang Cancer Prevention Center, which provided cancer screening and prevention services.</p><p>The Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research (SKI) was established in 1945 as the research division of Memorial Hospital. While Memorial owned the property and was responsible for all fundraising, SKI increasingly asserted corporate autonomy, and the records attest to the sometimes difficult efforts to streamline and negotiate the organizational and financial relationship between the two institutions. LSR's tenure at Memorial Hospital from the late 1940s to 1960 oversaw these negotiations which culminated in the successful merger of Memorial Center and the Sloan-Kettering Institute into MSKCC in April 1960.</p><p>Sloan-Kettering and Memorial had a third institutional connection with Cornell University Medical College and its affiliate New York Hospital. In June 1950, Sloan-Kettering and Memorial contracted with Cornell University to become part of the Medical College's program of graduate teaching. They also shared physicians and patients with New York Hospital.</p><p>Significant topics in this series include the administrative history of the two institutions and their continual efforts to define and coordinate their relationship to each other; the expansion and modernization of the physical facilities (air conditioning, the construction and/or renovation of hospital facilities such as the Children's Pavilion or the Tower Clinic, new laboratories and new technologies, new staff housing for nurses and physicians, and related architectural and space planning studies); and to a lesser extent the local impact of the center's expansion (Normandy Realty, tenant relocation, and the York Avenue Redevelopment Plan). Equally significant are files on the fundraising efforts and endowments that undergirded the Center's expansion, research, and operations, and that sought to ensure a foundation for teaching and research going forward. Several files concern relations – cooperative and competitive – with other cancer agencies with regard to fundraising and research support and with the auxiliary Society of Memorial Cancer Center. While several files touch on hospital operations, the 1953 Organization Survey presents a detailed review of hospital administration ("organization and control") at Memorial Center.</p><p>The general files under Memorial Hospital and Sloan-Kettering Institute as well as files on the American Cancer Society, offer glimpses into the history of cancer research and treatment. Topics include research in chemotherapy and radiation therapy, as well as considerations of the psychological impact of cancer and of links between biochemistry and mental disease. There is notably also in the Memorial and SKI general files some discussion of connections between smoking and cancer. Publicity files (for Memorial and for SKI) and files on laboratories such as the Meyer Physiology Laboratory and Betatron Unit, the Firestone Department of Radiation Therapy (endowed by the Firestone Fund) and, under SKI, the Proposed New Laboratory (East 68th St.) and the Walker Laboratory (for testing of new Chemotherapy substances), also provide some insight into research and treatment programs. The file on Francelia Butler contains a partial draft of a proposed history of cancer and Memorial Hospital.</p><p>There is an extensive and complicated correspondence with Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., throughout the MSKCC series, but especially in files on Memorial Hospital – Agreements, Organization (Correspondence), and Housing (Sloan Contribution); and in files on Sloan-Kettering Institute – By-Laws and Incorporation, and Walker Laboratory.</p><p>Other significant correspondents include Warren Weaver, Reginald G. Coombe, Cornelius (C. P. "Dusty") Rhoads, Henry T. Randall, Frank Drake, Frank A. Howard, Ogden White, Raymond Baarts, Richard Vanderwarker, and Robert Moses.</p></scopecontent><c id="8541429e86f84e309f8a038fec3addfb" level="file"><did><unittitle>James Ewing Hospital - General</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1948/1961" type="inclusive">1948-1961</unitdate><physdesc id="03713504cfbe6772009c9aaef97b6101">Still Image: black-and-white glossy print (8" x 10").</physdesc><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="2e32309efe1905e1f18e1b9b7e1a9068" label="Mixed Materials [893532.26.318]" type="box">26</container><container id="b536e923d0df16b28600aa34b55be868" parent="2e32309efe1905e1f18e1b9b7e1a9068" type="folder">352</container></did><scopecontent id="9fd3c40d7d7baffd7dce0757630c9334"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Includes photo of holiday decoration in James Ewing Hospital lobby, December 1956.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="e136b346e7e445539970964748a436b2" level="file"><did><unittitle>James Ewing Hospital - Arrangement with New York City</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1950/1951" type="inclusive">1950-1951</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="ece7209b343ce938963ba903f79854b2" label="Mixed Materials [893532.26.318]" type="box">26</container><container id="0907f8f9422bfc562955078913eb52a2" parent="ece7209b343ce938963ba903f79854b2" type="folder">353</container></did></c><c id="57880ebefed54562b0759d7455756298" level="file"><did><unittitle>James Ewing Hospital - Arrangement with New York City</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1952/1957" type="inclusive">1952-1957</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="b0fc5b6234901d3f898aa4f614c6970c" label="Mixed Materials [893532.26.318]" type="box">26</container><container id="f60f2cd414993f1306446f63dcacc2e1" parent="b0fc5b6234901d3f898aa4f614c6970c" type="folder">354</container></did></c><c id="69a9b272eeef44f49d4b727cba2af575" level="file"><did><unittitle>Memorial Hospital - General</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1938/1938">1938</unitdate><unitdate normal="1947/1947">1947</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="9bd3e09aca505312b3f9db6a7a94c187" label="Mixed Materials [893532.26.318]" type="box">26</container><container id="97a71e0f51a02c3201c8608d9d81c0d6" parent="9bd3e09aca505312b3f9db6a7a94c187" type="folder">355</container></did></c><c id="6ba4e019641a46729a26098fe1b69ee6" level="file"><did><unittitle>Memorial Hospital - General</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1948/1948">1948</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="4548b77eb161fe420955aa34de2aab38" label="Mixed Materials [893532.26.318]" type="box">26</container><container id="d45e78ceb522535f5379e1bbaeef07c4" parent="4548b77eb161fe420955aa34de2aab38" type="folder">356</container></did></c><c id="1f1fc633aeac4eb9b51cf4692a3db835" level="file"><did><unittitle>Memorial Hospital - General</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1949/1949">1949</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="74dc6eef946d62ea8a3b7ee6d55e4317" label="Mixed Materials [893532.26.318]" type="box">26</container><container id="5384395b0ba183f3c6ced53c22047d2d" parent="74dc6eef946d62ea8a3b7ee6d55e4317" type="folder">357</container></did></c><c id="791728999a574567804d064a9641b714" level="file"><did><unittitle>Memorial Hospital - General</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1950-01/1950-04" type="inclusive">1950 January-April</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="39c2d11456193c0bc3f1797d7261e6a8" label="Mixed Materials [893532.26.318]" type="box">26</container><container id="66858f2fc9784574104bd585de85be81" parent="39c2d11456193c0bc3f1797d7261e6a8" type="folder">358</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_314fbab629434609d99c34829a53653b"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>Carlton report;

The Mary French Rockefeller materials consist of personal files and of materials relating to the Billings Farm and Mansion and the estate of her mother, Mary Billings French. The personal papers include general correspondence files, contribution records, and financial, school, and gift files. The general files notably contain a few designs and swatches for dresses ordered from the French design house Paquin in the spring of 1940. Other topics include a musical evening that JDR, Jr. and Abby Aldrich Rockefeller hosted in honor of Mary French Rockefeller and Blanchette Hooker Rockefeller in 1936; the gift of Billings Park to the town of Woodstock in 1953-1956; and her service with the YWCA. Correspondents include JDR, Jr., John French, William Hearst, and Leonard Bernstein. The materials on Mary Billings French, who died in 1951, concern the disposition of her property and estate, and particularly concern the operation, management, and upkeep of the Billings Farm and Billings Mansion in Woodstock, Vermont. There are farm and dairy accounts in both the Mary Billings French files and the Billings Farm and Mansion files. Significant items include a notebook in the Billings Farm and Mansion files that lists the paintings and engravings belonging to Frederick Billings in Woodstock in 1882. The notebook also contains household accounts, 1878-1880, and bible notes. An October 1959 memorandum in the Billings Farm file concerns the mansion's Tiffany windows.</p></scopecontent><accessrestrict id="aspace_7b9e926dc080739b861a640b815704f2"><head>Conditions Governing Access note</head><p>Files relating to LSR's children are restricted from scholarly access.</p><p>Financial files relating to Mary French Rockefeller are restricted from scholarly access.</p></accessrestrict><c id="e5b657e6d9e44b9fa297780f95c71900" level="file"><did><unittitle>Rockefeller, Laura Spelman (Case) -
