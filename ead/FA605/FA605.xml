    <abstract id="84db9ea5e6a42c8d80c53dc489c0ae4b">The Urban Poverty (UP) Program was established as a subdivision of the United States and International Affairs Program (USIAP) in October 1981, taking over programs formerly administered by the divisions of National Affairs and Education and Public Policy. It administered programs benefiting the poor and inner-city residents in areas that included community development, employment and training, welfare, teen pregnancy, poverty, crime, and precollege education. In 1988, UP became a separate division, and in 1996, was merged into the Asset Building and Community Development Program (ASSETS). Gordon L. Berlin served as a Program Officer in the Urban Poverty Program from 1982 to 1987 and as its Deputy Director from 1987 until he left the Foundation in June 1988. He oversaw programs in employment, training, labor supply, welfare, and related educational issues. He also served on task forces, such as the Foundation's Task Force on Growth, Development and Employment (1984-1987) and the National Service Task Force (1984-1986). The Office Files of Gordon L. Berlin primarily consists of Program Files containing reports, data, research, notes, memoranda, and correspondence relating to such issues as national service, summer youth employment, workfare/welfare reform, remedial education and workplace literacy, preschool education and daycare, and school drop-out rates of at-risk youth. There are also some conference materials, subject and correspondence files, and a few speeches and writings relating to these and similar issues.</abstract>

    <head>Organizational History</head>
<p>The work of what became the Urban Poverty Program began when the Public Affairs Program was formally established in 1952. One of the goals of the new program was to work toward greater equality of opportunity for minority groups. In 1965, Public Affairs was succeeded by the National Affairs Division, created to focus on deep-rooted problems facing American society. Program areas under the National Affairs Division included Social Development and Urban and Metropolitan Development. In 1981, a reorganization of the Foundation replaced National Affairs with the United States and International Affairs Program (USIAP).</p><p>The Urban Poverty Program was established in October 1981 as a subdivision of USIAP, taking over programs formerly administered by the divisions of National Affairs and Education and Public Policy. It administered programs benefiting the poor and inner-city residents in areas that included community development, employment and training, welfare, teen pregnancy, poverty, crime, and precollege education. It also assumed oversight of the programs in Population and of new programs to combat infant and child mortality. The Urban Poverty Program became a program area within a newly organized Program Division in 1988 and was merged into the Asset Building and Community Development Program (ASSETS) in 1996.</p>  </bioghist>
