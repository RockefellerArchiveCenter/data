Rockefeller's personal copies of correspondence, reports, and other documents gathered during his service in the federal government in ten presidential appointments between 1940 and 1969. All manner of documents can be found in these files, from handwritten notes to printed reports. Marginal notes found in Rockefeller's handwriting are not uncommon. These records both duplicate and complement official government records held in the National Archives and in presidential libraries.</p>  </scopecontent>

Roosevelt that expressed concern over Nazi influence in that region and recommended a program of U.S. cooperation and assistance to raise the standard of living in Latin America and to improve relations between the nations of the western hemisphere. President Roosevelt responded by appointing Rockefeller to head a new program that became the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the agency coordinated the strategic defense of the region in the fields of information, economics, health, sanitation, agriculture, transportation, and culture and actively worked to frustrate Axis propaganda campaigns and economic designs on Latin America.</p><p>This subseries includes 6 cubic feet of correspondence and 19 cubic feet of bound printed material such as reports, newsletters, circulars issued by the various divisions of the OCIAA, and a complete set of "En Guardia," a Spanish-language picture magazine about the war that was produced and distributed by the OCIAA. There are also 15 reels of microfilm containing office correspondence: 6 reels of abstracts of incoming correspondence and 9 reels of complete outgoing correspondence. This correspondence may duplicate some of that within the paper files, but it does include additional correspondence as well.</p><p>Also found in this subseries are 61 motion picture films produced and distributed under the auspices of the OCIAA during the years 1940-1944. There is a substantial amount of documentation about the films in the papers of this series. These films appear to be NAR's personal copies. In 1942 the CIAA contracted with Walt Disney to produce 18 films, all of which exist at the Archive Center. The Julien Bryan films were produced for a primary and secondary level school audience. The films are in English or Spanish and address health, education, and cultural issues. The films are presented by the CIAA and are live-action in presentation unless otherwise noted.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><genreform source="aat">Moving Images</genreform></controlaccess><c id="fcf8859542a3431a8929e9de97fbf79b" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="Audiovisual materials"><did><unittitle>Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs (CIAA)</unittitle></did><bioghist id="aspace_893cbd2ba6da2b4ee8ab394293c21f00"><head>Biographical / Historical</head><p>Under Nelson Rockefeller, the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs was created to support various health and social wellness initiatives, as well as to maintain cultural and commercial relations between North and South America.

Eisenhower asked Rockefeller to chair a committee to study the executive branch of the federal government and recommend ways to streamline its organization and improve its efficiency and effectiveness. The committee was known progressively by three different names, which are reflected in the three titles in this subseries. As chairman, Rockefeller recommended 13 reorganization plans, 10 of which were approved by Congress. In 1953, Rockefeller also served as chairman of the Special Committee on the Reorganization of the Defense Department. Its recommendations were also accepted and approved. The records of his service in that committee are included in this subseries. The PACGO material also includes published reports and correspondence concerning two earlier government organization studies: the Hoover Commission and the Temple University Survey of Government Organization.</p></scopecontent><c id="b778503c6ca049f1b0395751a5904fad" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Special Committee on Government Organization

Nixon requested that Rockefeller consult with the leaders of the Latin American republics and determine the needs and conditions of those countries. In four separate trips during 1969, Rockefeller and a team of advisors visited 20 South American, Central American, and Caribbean republics. His advisors represented the fields of labor, cultural affairs, urban affairs, women's affairs, youth, media, finance and economics, and private enterprise. While Mr. Rockefeller met with the head of state and foreign minister of each country, the advisors met with public and private representatives of their respective fields. This subseries includes briefing books on each country provided by the U.S. Department of State, correspondence with Latin American and U.S. ambassadors, country reports prepared by the advisors, Rockefeller's notes from his meetings with heads of state, and drafts of the final report to Congress and President Nixon. (Note: Some documents in this subseries bear U.S. government security classifications and therefore remain closed.)</p></scopecontent><c id="c3b8fd27ac02411482d33d321cfa30ed" level="file"><did><unittitle>Argentina -

This subseries contains pages declassified in 2006 that had been separated previously from the folders of the same titles in Subseries 7.</p><p>NOTE: A single folder in this subseries (S1) originates from Rockefeller's appointment in 1969 to lead President Nixon's Mission to Latin America (Subseries 8). Some related documents in this subseries continue to bear U.S. government security classifications and therefore remain closed.</p></scopecontent><processinfo id="9ceb95004362c582970fc312a9e6f67b"><head>Processing Information</head><p>Subseries 9 contains documents that were declassified by the U.S. government during a review by government officials at the Archive Center from 2003 to 2006. Any document that remains classified since the review has been removed from its folder and replaced with a separation sheet to note its original and current locations. Therefore, all materials in the open folders are now declassified, whether or not the classification stamps on them indicate otherwise. Almost all of the declassified documents prominently display a federal agency's declassification stamp and date.</p></processinfo><c id="999824b0fec84b3f92f21c391cf1addd"
