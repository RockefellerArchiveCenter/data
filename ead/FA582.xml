    <abstract id="caddc626f96c3b7277c3f9bbf5f649c9">Wilson McNeil Lowry joined the Ford Foundation in 1953 as Program Director of Education. Mr. Lowry helped develop the Foundation's nascent program in the Humanities and the Arts and served as its first Director when the program was formally established in 1957. He later went on to serve as Vice President of the Office of Policy and Planning (1964-1966), Vice President of the Division of Humanities and the Arts (1965-1975), and Acting President of the Foundation (1965- 1966). He retired in 1975. The Office Files of Wilson McNeil Lowry document his oversight of numerous Ford Foundation programs, including Administration (ADMIN), Education (ED), Economic Development Administration (EDA), Fund for Adult Education (FAE), Humanities and the Arts (HA), International Affairs (IA), International Training and Research (ITR), Overseas Development (OD), Public Affairs (PA), Policy and Planning (PP), Population (POP), Science and Engineering (SE), and Special Projects (SPE). These Program Files make up the bulk of the collection. There are also files on the activities of the Board of Trustees as well as on the planning of the new Ford Foundation building in New York, the Building Committee, and the dedication ceremony in 1967. The files also include documents prepared or assembled by his staff, for example, on the Travel Study Award Program, and records of site visits to Arts and Humanities Program grantees and potential grantees. Of particular note in the collection are the extensive records of the Ford Foundation's involvement with and financial support for the McCone Commission investigation of the 1965 Los Angeles Watts Riots.</abstract>

<p>Wilson McNeil Lowry (1913-1993) was born on February 17, 1913 in Columbus, Kansas. He graduated from the University of Illinois with a B.A. in 1934 and taught in the University's Department of English from 1936 to 1941 when he received a PhD in English from the University. After service as a Navy lieutenant in World War II, Mr. Lowry worked in journalism, first as Associate Editor of the Dayton Daily News (1946-1947), then Chief of the Washington Bureau of James M. Cox Newspapers (1947-1952). He was Associate Director of the International Press Institute (1952-1953) when he was hired by the Ford Foundation as an assistant to William McPeak in order to direct the Foundation's education program. Mr. Lowry helped develop the Foundation's program in the area of Humanities and the Arts, and served as its first director when the program was formally established in 1957. He later served as Vice President of the Office of Policy and Planning (1964-1966), Vice President of the Division of Humanities and the Arts (1965-1975) and Acting President of the Foundation for a short time after the retirement of Henry T. Heald, until McGeorge Bundy was hired (1965-1966). Mr. Lowry retired in 1975, but continued to work as a pro bono consultant in the arts, including a term as president of the San Francisco Ballet (1988-1991). He died on June 6, 1993.</p>  </bioghist>

<p>The Office of the Arts originated as the Office of Humanities and the Arts, created in 1957 under the direction of its first Vice President, Wilson McNeil Lowry. In 1979, the Office of the Arts became a program area under Education and Public Policy, and after the 1997 reorganization, became part of Education, Media, Arts and Culture. Education, Media, Arts and Culture became the Knowledge, Creativity and Freedom Program in 2002.</p>  </bioghist>

Administration (ADMIN), Education (ED), Economic Development Administration (EDA), Fund for Adult Education (FAE), Humanities and the Arts (HA), International Affairs (IA), International Training and Research (ITR), Overseas Development (OD), Public Affairs (PA), Policy and Planning (PP), Population (POP), Science and Engineering (SE), and Special Projects (SPE). Staff memoranda, reports, and correspondence that concern more than one program area or cannot be clearly identified as having originated from a specific program have been filed before the clearly identified program materials. </p><p>The largest sets of files are for Education and Policy and Planning, indicative of Mr. Lowry's several years of oversight. Of particular note are the extensive Policy and Planning files concerning the issue of "Negro education" and the Foundation's Urban Extension Programs at various universities. The Public Affairs files reveal the Foundation's support for the investigation of the 1965 Watts riots in Los Angeles. The Science and Engineering folder on Conservation (1962-1965) represents the Foundation's work in conservation and the environment, which would become a new program area in 1966, and includes a federal task force report entitled "The Preservation of Natural Beauty" (1964). One member of that task force was William H. Whyte.</p></scopecontent><c id="e5162eefbc1f44b5a76561766878633c" level="file"><did><unittitle>Canada</unittitle><unitdate normal="1962/1962">1962 October 11-November 5</unitdate><container
