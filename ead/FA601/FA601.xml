<p>2004 - The original volume of 21 cubic feet accessioned by the Ford Foundation Archives in 2004 was reduced during processing to 8.5 cubic feet. Two boxes of grant files were transferred to the Closed Grant File Room for review at the time of processing.</p><p>Duplicates, reference, grant proposals, and documents that addressed purely financial matters were not retained. Many of the reference files dated to the 1950s and concerned Dr. Winnick's interests and activities, as well as his pre-Ford employment. For example, there were copies of several scholarly journals, including the Journal of Property Management or professional publications such as Journal of Housing, published by the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials (NAHRO). Annual reports for the City of New York and the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority were also removed from the collection.</p><p>Box 25 contains legal-sized subject files. These files are part of Series III. Subject Files and have been physically separated from other (letter-sized) subject files and placed at the end of the collection solely to accommodate their size.

This material has been added to the collection under Series III: Subject Files as Subseries 2: Subject Files Prior to Ford Foundation. At this time, another collection of Winnick material (previously RAC collection FA657: National Affairs, Urban and Metropolitan Development, Office Files of Louis Winnick) was combined with FA601 and the four folders that comprised this collection (.3 cu. ft.) were added to Series I and Series II.

    <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
<p>Louis Winnick was born in Romania on April 1, 1921 and he immigrated to Brooklyn, New York when he was one year old. He later worked in the Brooklyn Navy Yard during World War II and graduated from Brooklyn College with a BA in History and Economics in 1946. He was awarded an MA (1947) and a PhD (1953) in Economics from Columbia University. He taught Economics at Brooklyn College (1948-1949), Columbia University (1947-1949) and Rutgers University (1949-1950) and joined the Institute for Urban Land Use and Housing Studies at Columbia University (1950-1955). Dr. Winnick's studies on housing economics, an important field of study during the post-war housing shortage, would guide his future career.</p><p>In November of 1957, Dr. Winnick was appointed Director of Research for the New York City Planning Commission. He then served as Executive Director of the Temporary State Commission on Economic Expansion (1959-1961) before becoming Chief of the Bureau of Planning and Research for the New York City Housing and Redevelopment Board (1961-1963).</p><p>Dr. Winnick joined the Ford Foundation in March of 1963 as a Program Associate for the Public Affairs Program. A year later, in February of 1964, he was appointed the Public Affairs Program's Associate Director (1964-1966). In 1967 he became Program Officer in Charge of the Urban and Metropolitan Development unit of the National Affairs Division and in June 1968 he was promoted to Deputy Vice President of the Division. He held this position through several Foundation-wide reorganizations for the remainder of his career. Dr. Winnick helped establish the Foundation's focus on urban renewal grants as a result of the urban turmoil of the 1960s. He is also credited with persuading Foundation President George McBundy to begin funding "program related investments" in the form of equity investments and low-interest loans to schools, hospitals, housing organizations and small businesses in low-income urban areas.</p><p>After his retirement in 1986, he returned as a consultant to work on several projects for the Foundation, including the Urban Crisis Study and a book, New People in Old Neighborhoods, published by the Russell Sage Foundation in 1990 about the Sunset Park neighborhood of New York City. Dr. Winnick died on July 29, 2006, at age 85.</p><p>The Foundation's work in the area of urban poverty began with the establishment of the Public Affairs Program in 1952. One of the goals of the new program was to work toward greater equality of opportunity for minority groups. In 1965, a National Affairs Division was created to focus on deep-rooted problems facing American society. Program areas under the National Affairs Division included Social Development, and Urban and Metropolitan Development. The United States and International Affairs Program (USIAP) replaced National Affairs after a Foundation-wide reorganization in 1981. USIAP was broken up in another Foundation-wide reorganization in 1989.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Office Files of Dr. Louis Winnick document his work as a Program Officer, Associate Director and Vice President of the Foundation's National Affairs Division. The files also include some of his pre-Foundation files relating to his work on housing economics and urban renewal, and research for his post-retirement work on a Ford Foundation-funded consultancy grant. The bulk of these files date from 1960-1973, roughly the first half of Dr. Winnick's career with the Ford Foundation.</p><p>Dr. Winnick's leadership helped direct the Foundation towards a focus on urban renewal grants in the 1960s, and this is documented in his office files. The topic of urban development, and in particular the creation of affordable middle class housing in urban areas, appears to have been of particular interest to Dr. Winnick. Even before he joined the Foundation, Dr. Winnick attended conferences on the topic (see, e.g., Rental Housing Conference, 4/25-4/26/1957) and he continued to attend conferences as a representative of the Foundation (refer to the Conferences series).</p><p>Dr. Winnick's speeches and writing, which span from 1956-1967, reveal his long interest in the subjects of rental housing and urban renewal as well as the impact private foundations could have on urban development. Similarly, Dr. Winnick's post-retirement involvement on a Ford-funded Urban Crisis Study shows the topic continued to be of interest to him throughout his life. His Study work file, along with drafts and notes related to his book on the Sunset Park neighborhood, are available in the collection.</p><p>
The Office Files of Dr. Louis Winnick span from 1956 to 1958 and consist of correspondence, memoranda, reports, grantee and proposal evaluations, conference and meeting materials, and background information documenting his work on the field of urban renewal and urban development. The bulk of the files consist of subject files on a variety of topics including grantees, Foundation-related task forces, program areas or meetings, and areas or organizations of personal interest. His speeches and writings and the working file from his post-retirement Ford-funded grant are also available.</p><p>Note from original processors at the Ford Foundation: Ford Foundation Resource Identifier: ACC95/3 – Records, 1953-1976, 1967-1976 (bulk). This collection of office files was created by the Division of National Affairs, its subsidiary programs and its program and consultant staff. There is some material from National Affairs' predecessor program, Public Affairs. These files were maintained by the following Foundation staff members: Christopher Edley, Sanford M. Jaffe, William Pincus, Esther Schachter, Robert Goldmann, George Esser, Mitchell Sviridoff, David B. Carlson, John R. Coleman, Thomas E. Cooney, Ronald T. Gault, Eamon Kelly, Robert Schrank, William Pendleton and Louis Winnick. Also included are the chronological correspondence files of the Government and Law and the Resources and Environment programs.</p>  </scopecontent>

Contents</head><p>This series holds Dr. Winnick's chronological files maintained throughout his tenure at the Ford Foundation. The correspondence and memoranda for the years 1967 and 1987 to 1994 are not available. The documents focus on the National Affairs Program, grantees and proposals. The majority of the files hold correspondence with then-current, former or potential grant recipients. Some files also contain memoranda about grant modifications, reports on grantees by program officers, reviews of the National Affairs Program (12/29/1980), accounts of telephone conversations and meetings, and specific grant proposals, such as a memorandum dated May 10, 1974, from Dr. Winnick to President Bundy reflecting on future options for the Fund for the City of New York and the Fund for Michigan.</p><p>Other correspondence pertains to the Urban and Metropolitan Development program (1971 to 1982), which Dr. Winnick continued to direct as Program Officer in Charge. He also corresponded with colleagues and commented on academic publications (1964-2005).</p></scopecontent><c id="09ad0214ba2749e1acc0800e12999068" level="file"><did><unittitle>1964 Chron File (1 of

Several articles published in scholarly journals pre-date Dr. Winnick's time at Ford; the earliest is "Mortgage Credit in Perspective," co-authored with Ramsey Wood and published in the May 1956 issue of The <emph render="underline">Journal of Finance</emph>. Several drafts of articles dated later appear to have been written "on spec" and there is no indication they were ever published. The one writing not related to urban renewal or housing is an article containing Dr. Winnick's comments on the New York State economy and the state constitution during the New York State constitutional convention of 1967.
