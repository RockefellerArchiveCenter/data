    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>History of the Fellowship Program at the Rockefeller Foundation:</p><p>The Rockefeller Foundation Fellowship Program began in 1917 with a few appointments and grew gradually so that there were several hundred fellowships awarded each year by 1925. As stated in the Directory of Fellowship Awards, the basic principle upon which the program was created was "the conviction that individuals can and should be developed for future leadership and creative achievement in important fields of endeavor. Thus the functions of the Rockefeller Foundation (RF) fellowship program have been to select individuals of outstanding promise in the fields of interest defined by the general program of the Foundation, and to help prepare individuals to make significant contributions to research and teaching or public service in the future." [Note: Rockefeller Foundation, Directory of Fellowship Awards, For the Years 1917-1950. New York, 1950.]</p><p>The RF wanted the fellowship program to be an international exchange crossing all racial, cultural and national boundaries. To help facilitate this exchange, the RF installed a general rule that a fellow needed to travel and study outside of his/her own native country. Initially the RF intended for the fellowship program to focus on supporting individuals outside of the United States but over the years, a great number of U.S. citizens were awarded fellowships and related scholarships.</p><p>All fellowships were awarded within the five divisions of the Rockefeller Foundation: International Health Division (IHD), Medical Sciences, Natural Sciences, Social Sciences and Humanities.</p><p>The early fellows mostly came from the Western European countries and concentrated on medical and health issues. During the 1950s and 1960s, the fellowship program changed focus. Beginning in this period, fellows were predominantly from Latin America, Africa and India. Also the emphasis changed; fellowships were awarded primarily in agriculture and public health.</p><p>The Rockefeller Foundation had a standard set of criteria for its fellowship awards. Applicants needed to have finished their formal education with advanced degrees and training. They also needed to be employed by universities, research institutes or governmental bodies. Direct applications were discouraged; potential applicants were identified by RF officers. A fellowship award was typically one to two years in duration.</p>  </bioghist>
