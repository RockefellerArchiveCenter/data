    <abstract id="6dd5363513a0750924f5beac86f402aa">The papers of Elinor Barber, Program Officer of the Office of the Vice President, International Division (OVP/ID) from 1967 to 1981, document her activities and those of the International Division, particularly those related to Foundation programs on the rights and status of women, affirmative action, and education, during this period.  They were sent to the Foundation's Archives in January 1982.

The papers consist primarily of correspondence, memoranda, and Barber's rough notes summarizing meetings and conferences she attended. They are divided into two series. Arrangement of the series and of files within the series is based as closely as possible on the original order in which the papers were maintained.</abstract>
