    <abstract id="aspace_6dd5363513a0750924f5beac86f402aa">The papers of Elinor Barber, Program Officer of the Office of the Vice President, International Division (OVP/ID) from 1967 to 1981, document her activities and those of the International Division, particularly those related to Foundation programs on the rights and status of women, affirmative action, and education, during this period.  They were sent to the Foundation's Archives in January 1982.

The papers consist primarily of correspondence, memoranda, and Barber's rough notes summarizing meetings and conferences she attended. They are divided into two series. Arrangement of the series and of files within the series is based as closely as possible on the original order in which the papers were maintained.</abstract>

There is also correspondence for the years 1973 - 1981 between Barber and  Ford Foundation consultants, selected grantee and membership organizations, individuals and organizations seeking grants, and other donor organizations.  Correspondents of special interest include Mary Jean Bowman, Arvonne Fraser, Adrienne Germain, Janet Giele, Hanna Papanek, and Audrey Smock.</p><p>There is extensive material on the activities of seven successive Foundation committees on programs for women's rights and for affirmative action for the years 1970 to 1981: the Committee on the Role of Women; the Task Force on the Status of Women; the Affirmative Action Committee; the Coordinating Committee on Women's Programs; the Committee on Women in International Programs; the Women's Programs Group; and the International Division Committee on Women.
