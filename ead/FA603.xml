<p>Level 2 Minimal Processing was originally completed in 2013 for the first accession of Peter W. Stanley Office Files transferred to the Rockefeller Archive Center. Files were described according to the collection's current arrangement scheme, but materials remained in their original folders and boxes.</p><p>
Level 3 Standard Processing was then completed for the first accession as well as for the 2019:030 accession of material by Darren Young in May 2019. Material in the first accession was rehoused into archival folders and boxes and assigned instance information but was kept at the beginning of each of the collection's 4 series. Material from the later accession was integrated into the collection's arrangement scheme and added to the ends of the different series.</p>  </processinfo>

<p>Ford Foundation archive was deposited at the RAC in 2011. Ford Foundation records, correspondence, reports, program files, and officers' papers were transferred to and accessioned by the RAC beginning in 2011.</p><p>
A later set of Peter W. Stanley Office Files was transferred to the RAC in 2019 and was ingested by the RAC as Accession 2019:030. This accession was incorporated into the collection during processing in May 2019.</p><p>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>Collection contains the office files of Peter W. Stanley who served as Program Officer in Charge and then Program Director of the Ford Foundation's Education and Culture Program from between 1983 and 1991. The Education and Culture Program was situated within the Foundation's United States and International Affairs Program (USIAP). In addition to holding the records that Stanley and his office created and maintained, the collection also includes some material from the larger Education and Culture Program. A few of these documents were created from before and after Stanley's tenure at the Foundation. The records' creators appear to have organized Stanley's files according to file type. The collection's arrangement scheme represents these different types with the implementation of 4 different series. The series are: Series 1. Correspondence files; Series 2. Subject files; Series 3. Meeting and trip files; and Series 4. General files. However, terms like Desk file and Work file were also used to label many of the collection's files and remain part of those files' titles. Moreover, there does not appear to be a clear distinction between the structure and content of files in Series 4. General files and some of the files in Series 1. Correspondence files. Different and evolving filing systems were probably imposed on the records throughout their creation, use, and management.</p><p>
Correspondence, memoranda, program reviews, budgets, notes, drafts, and reports document the Education and Culture Program's grant giving priorities and activities during this time period. Two major areas of concern were the improvement of access and equity in higher education through increased recruitment and retention of minority students and the improvement of undergraduate education through enhanced teaching, scholarship, and academic programs. Materials in the collection also regard the Education and Culture Program's interest in assessing the need for special support to the Philippines following the presidency of Ferdinand Marcos, cultural preservation, and the Ford Foundation's developing External Affirmative Action Program (EAAP).</p><p>
Other material types found within the collection include brochures, invitations, schedules, invoices, participant lists, publications, Recommended Grant Action reports (RGAs), and press releases.</p><p>
The collection consists of more than one accession of Peter W. Stanley office files. A later set of records transferred to and ingested by the Rockefeller Archive Center in 2019 (Accession 2019:030) shared the same file types as the original material and was therefore integrated into the established collection. These later files were added to the appropriate series and placed where the original files ended.</p>  </scopecontent>
  <arrangement id="d21aff7bf8476749260dac89c378268c">
    <head>Arrangement</head>
<p>Arranged in 4 series by file type. Material originating from the first accession of Peter W. Stanley Office Files remains at the beginning of each series. The material from the later set of records (Accession 2019:030) shared the same file types as the records in the original accession. Therefore, it was divided across the 4 different series during processing and added to where the first files ended. </p><p>
Collection arrangement is as follows:</p><p>
Series 1. Chronological files, 1983-1992</p><p>
Series 2. Subject files, 1980-1991</p><p>
Series 3. Meeting and trip files, 1980-1991</p><p>
Series 4. General files, 1986-1992</p>  </arrangement>

Stanley and the larger Ford Foundation Education and Culture Program from between 1983 and 1992. Not all of the correspondence files in the series are organized in the same way. Files titled Chronological correspondence contain correspondence from a particular segment of time (such as a year), alphabetically arranged by the name of the correspondent. There are also some files that contain subsections that group together different pieces of correspondence based upon the entity (or entities) that was principally responsible for creating those items. Miscellaneous correspondence files mostly contain invitations to events from external organizations and individuals. </p><p>
The correspondence in the series mainly regards requests for grant funding, grant supported projects, program administration, and program reviews.  </p></scopecontent><c id="ba59854c035a4049b2ed2d5aa64ad57b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Chronological correspondence</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1990/1990">1990</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="bbe50fdae9ea6b2b48148f2cce30bd5d" label="mixed materials [A0000000114096]" type="box">1</container><container id="dd598a56860d3fb6e9365878cdaab4a3" parent="bbe50fdae9ea6b2b48148f2cce30bd5d" type="folder">1-5</container></did></c><c id="d83460432d6d4e46889d186b93e77b15" level="file"><did><unittitle>Chronological correspondence</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1990/1991" type="inclusive">1990-1991</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="6c8c6dd5989357f5202d535fc5f1b789" label="mixed materials [A0000000114097]" type="box">2</container><container id="5bd1233b1a2c7e146b066e17c768a890" parent="6c8c6dd5989357f5202d535fc5f1b789" type="folder">6-8</container></did></c><c id="4a0b7f7992d04b49a59af245510b7504" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence -

Stanley and the larger Ford Foundation Education and Culture Program created from between 1980 and 1991. Files regard internal meetings within the Education and Culture Program and between Education and Culture and other parts of the Foundation as well as meetings Stanley had with universities, foundations, and other institutions and individuals focused on issues and projects primarily related to higher education. Internal meetings chiefly concerned matters of program review and direction, while external meetings chiefly concerned projects and initiatives seeking or receiving support from the Education and Culture Program. Agendas, submitted papers, draft papers, program outlines, invitation and participant lists, and program outlines document the preparation of these various meetings and trips. There is also a lot of correspondence within the series that shows the follow-up communications Stanley had with the individuals and organizations he met and visited.</p></scopecontent><c id="3b874b7f6f2e45e7bcfc37b3429a2efb" level="file"><did><unittitle>Barnes Collection at Lincoln University</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1989/1989">1989</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="8853552d8aefe2606a2fd5452f836b05" label="mixed materials [A0000000114116]" type="box">21</container><container id="5467c61fcb99d544759e78cdd2dc39d4" parent="8853552d8aefe2606a2fd5452f836b05" type="folder">167</container></did></c><c id="50cd785470b14887bf06568442eb20de" level="file"><did><unittitle>Soviet Union trip</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1989/1989">1989</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="756e57d53fe4d0fb5b95c481788eea72" label="mixed materials [A0000000114116]" type="box">21</container><container id="6d433cab8f877938e5b0e41ea9572479" parent="756e57d53fe4d0fb5b95c481788eea72" type="folder">168</container></did></c><c id="2493467ca960457795f81396fd085963" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ed Meade's Symposium</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1989/1989">1989</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="20281a1daea6ccae4554c360bdf32b21" label="mixed materials [A0000000114116]" type="box">21</container><container id="f14c6bf53929fbe644d907d1bdb1e191" parent="20281a1daea6ccae4554c360bdf32b21" type="folder">169</container></did></c><c id="45b403648d4c4bf78bacc8655c96c820" level="file"><did><unittitle>Association of Fund Raising Officers (AFRO, Inc.) meeting and luncheon</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1989/1989">1989</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="94492b0536767b99c97846c9419303a9" label="mixed materials [A0000000114116]" type="box">21</container><container id="f25c40a297290205165e46abebd6fdf7" parent="94492b0536767b99c97846c9419303a9" type="folder">170</container></did></c><c id="640194576c3d45bc9e893d86757913ad" level="file"><did><unittitle>Quantitative Understanding: Amplifying Student Achievement and Reasoning (QUASAR) briefing</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1989/1989">1989</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="54ff987ee4255db6479f2bfbaea88163" label="mixed materials [A0000000114117]" type="box">22</container><container id="138101a56e1e5f9e40882bbad98a28ba" parent="54ff987ee4255db6479f2bfbaea88163" type="folder">171</container></did></c><c id="bb0b6487fc2b4de7bf73a9e897cfe262" level="file"><did><unittitle>San Francisco, California meetings</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1989/1990" type="inclusive">1989-1990</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="272bc56fc4d1ed6bc74844fe9058c67f" label="mixed materials [A0000000114117]" type="box">22</container><container id="f11a428565698e773b2fc8c0aa1b3c9a" parent="272bc56fc4d1ed6bc74844fe9058c67f" type="folder">172</container></did></c><c id="2b05abcc7ca84296ac9b3cd9bfb5c20f" level="file"><did><unittitle>Harare, Zimbabwe meeting and Mozambique</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1989/1990" type="inclusive">1989-1990</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="f720445c2cf35818287a6f55f7b91f87" label="mixed materials [A0000000114117]" type="box">22</container><container id="06dcddb856ef1b9d4092fb0959579400" parent="f720445c2cf35818287a6f55f7b91f87" type="folder">173</container></did></c><c id="e004484ff4d84a3194cad95122f5af4e" level="file"><did><unittitle>Education and Culture Staff Meeting</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1990/1990">1990</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="25e3a3c9c340baa94e5dee6d35a6f976" label="mixed materials [A0000000114117]" type="box">22</container><container id="ab66f598bbdf088aeab85993f254056b" parent="25e3a3c9c340baa94e5dee6d35a6f976" type="folder">174</container></did></c><c id="b3cce46f510044c487ce0ac9e75df5d7" level="file"><did><unittitle>Puerto Rico Community Foundation visit</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1989/1990" type="inclusive">1989-1990</unitdate><langmaterial id="57cd1eaf5efca968ca31ca6ece143428">Materials predominately in English.
