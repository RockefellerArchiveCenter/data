    <abstract id="9362616bfd645ed03626ac7a3af460c2">The Office Files of William O. Sweeney document his work as a project specialist in population communications for the Foundation from 1969 to 1981. The collection is organized into two series: Project Files (1970-1980), and Reports and Writings (1968-1977). Mr. Sweeney's Project Files detail his work on the Foundation's Population Communications Project. The Reports and Writings focus on population communications. The files hold research reports, evaluations, conference papers and other writings authored by Mr. Sweeney The earliest Foundation grants for population research and family planning occurred under the aegis of the Divisions of International Affairs or Overseas Development. The Population Program was officially established in 1963, and became part of the International Division in 1966. Following a Foundation-wide reorganization in 1981, the Population program became an independent program area. In 1992 the Population Program was subsumed into Reproductive Health and Population. Following the Foundation-wide reorganization in 1997, Reproductive Health and Population became Human Development and Reproductive Health, a subset of the ASSETS Program. William O. Sweeney was retained by the Foundation as Project Specialist for the Population Communications Project when that project was initiated in 1969. Throughout his time with Ford, he travelled extensively assisting developing nations such as China, Egypt, Indonesia, Kenya, Korea, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam with the establishment of family planning programs.</abstract>

    <head>Organizational History</head>
<p>The earliest Foundation grants for population research and family planning occurred under the aegis of the Divisions of International Affairs or Overseas Development. The Population Program was officially established in 1963, and became part of the International Division in 1966. Following a Foundation-wide reorganization in 1981, the Population program once again was made independent. In 1992 the Population Program was subsumed into Reproductive Health and Population. Following a second Foundation-wide reorganization in 1997, Reproductive Health and Population became Human Development and Reproductive Health, a subset of the ASSETS Program.</p>  </bioghist>
