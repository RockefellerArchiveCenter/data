    <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
<p>Nelson Caryl Davis was born in Osceola, Nebraska, on August 26, 1892, the posthumous son of John E. Davis. His mother remarried and moved to Ceres, California, in 1896, where young Davis attended local public schools. After graduating from high school, he entered the Hospital Corps of the United States Army and spent two years (1910-1912) in the Philippine Islands. While in the armed forces, his interest turned toward the study of tropical diseases, which was to constitute his life's work. Between 1914 and 1917 he completed undergraduate work at The University of California at Berkeley, and immediately entered medical studies at The University of California Medical School.</p><p>On January 12, 1917, he married Mary Faye Caulkins of Ceres, California, then also a student at The University of California at Berkeley. This marriage was to produce five sons, one of whom died in infancy (1923) during Dr. Davis's first period of service in Brazil.</p><p>After a short period of inactive military service during World War I, Dr. Davis received a Hooper Foundation fellowship in medical research (1918) and did studies of liver pathology with Dr. George H. Whipple. This research resulted in his first published articles. He also briefly served as an assistant in the Department of Pathology at The University of California before receiving his M.D. in 1921.</p><p>In May 1922, Dr. Davis became a regular member of the staff of the International Health Board of The Rockefeller Foundation. His appointment as Junior Field Director carried him to Porto Alegre, Brazil where he participated in hookworm control and related programs. He was reassigned to malaria work in Argentina, where he was stationed intermittently from July 1925 to July 1927. This assignment increased his interest in medical entomology, and he continued to produce articles on anopheline mosquitoes and malaria for the rest of his life.</p><p>Upon returning to the United States on leave in the summer of 1927, he attended courses at The School of Hygiene and Public Health of The Johns Hopkins University. After a brief supplementary period of study (March-May 1931), he was awarded the degree of Doctor of Public Health from that institution.</p><p>At the end of his first study leave (July 1928), Dr. Davis undertook the establishment of a laboratory at Bahia, Brazil, to carry on yellow fever research in South America and also to conduct laboratory studies for the yellow fever control service maintained jointly by the Government of Brazil and The Rockefeller Foundation. Through his research it was established that yellow fever was transmitted by several species of mosquitoes other than Aedes aegypti, the previously recognized agent of infection. His collaborators in this work included Drs. Martin Frobisher, Jr., Raymond C. Shannon, J. Austin Kerr, and Henry W. Kumm. Dr. Paul A. Lewis, one of his early coworkers at the Bahia laboratory, died of yellow fever early in 1929 - one of the noted martyrs to that disease. Dr. Davis contracted it at the same time, but survived.</p><p>Complications arising from this bout with yellow fever led to Dr. Davis's own death four years later. During his second period of study at Johns Hopkins (1931), his gall bladder had been removed. Although in steady pain, he continued his heavy load of research and leadership of the Bahia laboratory until his sudden death on October 20, 1933, from acute edema.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
<p>The Nelson C. Davis Collection will be of interest both to the historian of medical research and of medical education. The lecture notes and class papers prepared by Dr. Davis at all levels of his training have been preserved in this collection. Also included are drafts of papers, some of them unpublished, at various stages of preparation, reprints of his published articles, and a wide variety of supporting research materials (such as reprints and periodicals), many taken from Portuguese- or Spanish-language publications. A substantial portion of his laboratory diary (kept at Bahia from 1928 to 1933) can be found in this collection as well as a number of field notebooks and records of experiments. Personal correspondence, however, has been rather scantily preserved.</p><p>Significant correspondents in this collection include Mark F. Boyd, Rollin C. Dean, John H. Janney, Robert H. Kirk, Henry W. Kumm, E. R. Rickard, Francis M. Root, F. F. Russell, Wilbur A. Sawyer, Fred L. Soper, and George K. Strode.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Related Archival Materials note</head>
<p>A complete transcript of the laboratory duties and of much of the field notes kept by Dr. Davis at the Bahia laboratory can be found in the archives of The Rockefeller Foundation (Record Group 1.1, Series 305.O). Correspondence with Rockefeller Foundation officials -- especially F. F. Russell and Fred L. Soper -- may also be found in the Foundation archives (Record Group 1.1, Series 305.O and 305.I). Also available are a large number of photographs relating to the work of the Bahia laboratory contemporaneous with Dr. Davis's period of service there -- many of which originally accompanied his reports to the Foundation.</p>  </relatedmaterial>

It includes monthly reports, some correspondence, maps of areas visited, examination charts, diaries, field note books, and an expense book.</p><p>Dr. Davis's foreign service falls into two main divisions - the first (1922-1927) spent mainly in Brazil, where he engaged in hookworm and malaria control work; the second (1928-1933) as director of the Yellow Fever Laboratory in Bahia, Brazil. With the exception of some time spent in Argentina (July-December 1925 and January-July 1927), his activities are amply documented by the material in this series. Further correspondence is available in the Rockefeller Foundation Archives, Record Group 1.1, Series 305.I and 305.O.</p><p>The laboratory diaries for the Yellow Fever Laboratory at Bahia originally consisted of seven bound and numbered handwritten volumes; of these, volume IV (February-October 1931) is missing. This volume was kept by Dr. Martin Frobisher, Jr., in the absence of Dr. Davis. A complete typescript of these diaries, including the missing volume, together with typescripts of some of Dr. Davis's field note books, may be found in the Rockefeller Foundation Archives, Record Group 1.1, Series 305.O.</p><p>This series continues with typescript reports or articles sent to Dr. Davis for comment or information by officers of The Rockefeller Foundation, and concludes with copies of The International Health Board's newspaper in Brazil ("O Telescopio" - later, "O Saneamento").</p></scopecontent><c id="e5ddd7ff75f8435d8c491fd117322011" level="series"><did><unittitle>Professional Papers - Porto Alegre, Brazil</unittitle><unitid>2.1</unitid><unitid type="aspace_uri">/repositories/2/archival_objects/65165</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1921/1927" type="inclusive">1921-1927</unitdate></did><scopecontent id="29147c7196eaf9043a8e8ef119c61301"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>This subseries consists of reports, charts, graphs, examination records, an expense book, and field note books kept during Dr. Davis's first period of service in South America, spent primarily in Porto Alegre and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.</p></scopecontent><c id="2d9838e15af84830a2e6d8ff88123984" level="file"><did><unittitle>Porto Alegre -
