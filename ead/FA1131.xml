    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The Commonwealth Fund was founded in 1918 by Mrs. Stephen (Anna) Harkness with the mandate that it should "do something for the welfare of mankind". Most of the Fund's grants throughout its existence have been in the broad field of health. Over the years, The Commonwealth Fund's work led to the development of the field of child guidance, contributed to the emergence of progressive public health departments in communities throughout the country, supported the construction of rural hospitals, and supported the development of new medical schools in the United States. Several facets of the Fund's continued interest in health are seen in this collection, including the availability of quality medical education and the Fund's concern for the "underserved" or vulnerable populations among us â€“ including women, children, minority populations, those in urban areas, the elderly, and the financially disadvantaged.</p>  </bioghist>
