<p>Richard Horovitz (1946-1991) was a foundation executive who worked at the Ford Foundation for over ten years. Horovitz started at the Ford Foundation as an Assistant Program Officer in the International Division, Middle East and Africa Program. Following a change in the Foundation's programming, he became a Program Officer in the Developing Country Programs and later became the Foundation's Representative for West Africa and was based in Dakar, Senegal. After that assignment, he returned to his position as Program Officer in the Developing Country Programs and was based at the New York City office.</p><p>In 1989, Horovitz became Executive Director of the Panos Institute. He served in that position until the time of his death in 1991. Horovitz died from AIDS-related complications. His partner, author and poet Melvin Dixon, died from the same cause one year later. The Institute for International Education (IIE) named the Richard A. Horovitz Fund for Professional Development in his memory. The award is for African artists and scholars in the humanities and the social sciences.</p><p>Horovitz completed his undergraduate education at Middlebury College and earned a master's and doctorate degree from Northwestern University. Prior to joining the Ford Foundation, he had positions with the Peace Corps as a volunteer in the Ivory Coast from 1976 to 1978 and with the University of Abidjan as a visiting lecturer.</p>  </bioghist>
