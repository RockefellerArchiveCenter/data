    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This series documents the family planning program activities and administrative operations of the Tunisia and Ceylon Population Council Regional Offices. The Offices were supported through grants provided by the Ford Foundation. They generally focused on collecting statistics related to acceptance and use of contraceptives and family planning services by local populations, projecting population trends, supporting national family planning programs like l'Office National du Planning Familial et de la Population(National Office of Family Planning and Population) in Tunisia and the Family Planning Bureau in Ceylon (present day Sri Lanka), conducting family planning related research, providing and participating in family planning education programs and services, and collaborating on family planning projects with international agencies like the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Swedish International Development Authority (SIDA), the World Bank, and various United Nations organizations.</p>

<p>Files are organized by the Office to which they pertain. Records within the Tunisia Office files are more project and program focused whereas records within the Ceylon Office files are more administration focused. In addition to containing a group of office files created by the Tunisia regional Population Council post, the series also includes a group of press clippings that the Tunisia Office staff members had collected during the course of their duties.</p>

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The Population Council was founded by John D. Rockefeller 3rd in 1952 to undertake "significant activities in the broad field of population." Its goal has been to bring about a reduction in the number of births that occur in the world. In Its early years, the business of the Population Council was conducted by a Demographic Division and a Biomedical Division. Through its Demographic Division, the Council sought to document what it conceived to be an overpopulation problem threatening many areas of the world. To accomplish this purpose, the Division facilitated research on the economic, social, and psychological factors which affect the growth and decline of human population. This Council-assisted research effort was conducted not only by staff of the Demographic Division but also by other institutions and scholars, some of whom received Council grants and fellowships and some of whom received informal advice and consultation on how to design and execute studies.</p> 

<p>The Biomedical Division, which, beginning in 1959, occupied a laboratory at The Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research (now The Rockefeller University), has conducted pure and applied research on plant, animal, and human reproductive physiology and on the development, the physiological action, and the safety and effectiveness of contraceptive methods. The Council facilitated similar types of medical research by non-Council scientists at other institutions by giving grants and fellowships for such research. The Council's biomedical research and its support for research by non-Council scientists were instrumental in the development of the modern intrauterine coil and the birth control pill.</p> 

<p>In about 1960, the scope of Population Council activities expanded. The Council began to render practical and technical aid to foreign nations. Beginning in that year, the Demographic Division, in addition to supervising research, became involved in Pakistan's family planning program, extending practical and technical aid in organizing and running a national family planning program. By 1964 the Council's Demographic Division had assisted in organizing family planning programs in South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Tunisia, and Turkey. In that year, the Council created the Technical Assistance Division. This division, in ensuing years, continued the assistance of the Council in the countries where it had already become involved and also helped start and run programs in India, Morocco, the Philippines, and Puerto Rico.</p> 

<p>An underlying aim of the Council's grant programs has been to encourage the development and growth of institutions that would promote family planning programs. To this end, the Council has given grants and advice to various universities and research centers for starting and upgrading programs for demographic and biomedical training and research programs; has assisted the United Nations to set up and expand regional Demographic Training and Research Centres in Bombay, India, Santiago, Chile, and Cairo, Egypt; has worked with the Ford Foundation on family planning programs in Pakistan, India, and North Africa.</p> 

<p>In addition to rendering technical aid and sponsoring research, the Council has undertaken several complementary public relations efforts. To reach the general populations of the United States and of foreign nations, Council officers have worked to inform the mass media about population issues and to encourage magazine articles, movies, and books dealing with population matters. Council officers and representatives have also made trips and prepared reports to convince various foreign government leaders of the importance and the desirability of promulgating family planning programs. In addition, Council officers participated in and helped organize and finance conferences for demographers and medical scientists active in population work.</p> 

<p>The Population Council has obtained its financial support through large contributions. The Ford and Rockefeller Foundations and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund have been the principal institutional supporters of the Council. John D. Rockefeller 3rd has been the single most significant individual backer of the Council.</p>

<p>To conduct a thorough search for records on a given topic, it is essential to look for material in as many different sections of the series and under as many different names or titles as possible.</p></arrangement><scopecontent id="27b9b24c7bd1d53006aeb217e66edf3f"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This subseries contains correspondence, memoranda, reports, tables, surveys, and clinic forms related to the family planning program activities of the Tunisia Population Council Office. Chief correspondents include Population Council Resident Advisors Dr. Melvyn C, Thorne (1968-1972), Joseph A. Grinblat (1972-1973, formerly Research and Evaluation Advisor from 1969-1972), and Alain J. Marcoux. The subseries houses much of the Resident Advisors' (also referred to as Counseiller Residents and Representatives) correspondence with: 1) Population Council officials like Joel Montague, Regional Director, and Robert J. Lapham, Program Research and Evaluation; 2) Partnering international agencies like the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the World Bank, the World Health Organization (WHO), and the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF); and 3) Different Heads of the various national family planning programs in Tunisia. The different program Heads include Dr. Amor Daly, Dr. Abderrahman Mzelini, Dr. Ben Samil, Dr. T. B. Ben Cheikh, Dr. Mohsen Bahri, Chedli Tnani, and Mezri Chekir. Within the subseries, reports and correspondence document the organizational evolution of the various national family planning programs in Tunisia up until l'Office National du Planning Familial et de la Population (National Office of Family Planning and Population) was official established in 1973. Previous incarnations of the program include Direction Exterieure du Planning Familial, Direction du Planning Familial et de la Protection Maternelle et Infantile, and l'Institut National du Planning Familial et de la Protection Maternelle et Infantile.</p> 

<p>Many materials document the Office's data collection activities in relation to demographic surveys, population projections, and family planning program service statistics. Also prevalent within the subseries are records concerning the Office's engagement with family planning conferences and educational programs. Correspondence, reports, promotional materials, invitations, and lists of attendees provide evidence of the Office's participation in these activities.</p> 

<p>The End-of-Tour reports by Thorne and Grinblat may prove particularly helpful to researchers seeking to learn more about the organizational history and program performance of the Population Council office in Tunisia. Furthermore, many files within the subseries include description notes that summarize their contents. These notes were likely compiled by previous processing archivists and may not fully or accurately describe the materials of every file.</p>     

<p>Materials in the subseries refer to Grinblat as both Joseph and Jofred Grinblat.</p> </scopecontent><c id="5d2cd30ea198a5a30db0be0ca208319f" level="file"><did><unittitle>Organisation du Planning

<p>Press clippings in the first part of the subseries are grouped into files based upon the articles' dates of publication. These files contain clippings from mostly Tunisian newspapers that were published between 1969 and 1975.

Rockefeller served as the Chairman of the Population Council Board of Trustees at the time that this article was published.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="4b1a7ff797ba27b97aa09c40171683b9" level="file"><did><unittitle>Clippings: Employment</unittitle><unitdate normal="1969/1970" type="inclusive">1969-1970</unitdate><container altrender="Legal Document Box" id="9e51d5f1b2122374c42ee72e3c7a06ff" label="mixed materials [A0000000079660]" type="box">10</container><container id="ae10aacbed05df00825240ef32bbea28" parent="9e51d5f1b2122374c42ee72e3c7a06ff" type="folder">130</container></did></c><c id="e9bb21e64c31294638a88d47f9a036c6" level="file"><did><unittitle>Clippings: Family planning</unittitle><unitdate normal="1969/1970" type="inclusive">1969-1970</unitdate><container altrender="Legal Document Box" id="1cdb51e36ae6ef66ceb8b34ff7d011bb" label="mixed materials [A0000000079660]" type="box">10</container><container id="56f3bc74d0ee5f3037f39b1a9cfb5b1e" parent="1cdb51e36ae6ef66ceb8b34ff7d011bb" type="folder">131</container></did></c><c id="f274764105be74e07c6e18dbd98b5a8e" level="file"><did><unittitle>Clippings: Family welfare</unittitle><unitdate normal="1969/1969">1969</unitdate><container altrender="Legal Document Box" id="63954ef87ed53725a7123f8b71a1358a" label="mixed materials [A0000000079660]" type="box">10</container><container id="164803929820e9dbdc3d27cbddc15eb4" parent="63954ef87ed53725a7123f8b71a1358a" type="folder">132</container></did></c><c id="f95282c813eea23afaa4d69de1974445" level="file"><did><unittitle>Clippings: Logement</unittitle><unitdate normal="1969/1970" type="inclusive">1969-1970</unitdate><container altrender="Legal Document Box" id="25452d26ce9d3d2297c2dc95dff78365" label="mixed materials [A0000000079660]" type="box">10</container><container id="6bdada4973ed5e26858fd2b810a32a48" parent="25452d26ce9d3d2297c2dc95dff78365" type="folder">133</container></did></c><c id="c30e3b6c91c0670fb2516d5d4d2ffed4" level="file"><did><unittitle>Clippings: General</unittitle><unitdate normal="1969/1969">1969</unitdate><container altrender="Legal Document Box" id="09ce1cdb1e410bf26102ea4c3de9ce38" label="mixed materials [A0000000079660]" type="box">10</container><container id="93595d858664fa8b2744cbca20e69b50" parent="09ce1cdb1e410bf26102ea4c3de9ce38" type="folder">134</container></did></c><c id="7ea1357ce6450b01baf182ec9c2cd8d7" level="file"><did><unittitle>Clippings: Education</unittitle><unitdate normal="1969/1969">1969</unitdate><container altrender="Legal Document Box" id="1697bb75039977015401ec806a55661a" label="mixed materials [A0000000079660]" type="box">10</container><container id="bde7fedb83fc43bd0eb8f8601aa74d9a" parent="1697bb75039977015401ec806a55661a" type="folder">135</container></did></c><c id="5095e03f317f301e5e4961e0ee9a74bb" level="file"><did><unittitle>Clippings: Coupures de journaux etrangers, VIII el Congres du Parti Socialiste Destourien</unittitle><unitdate normal="1971/1971">1971</unitdate><container altrender="Legal Document Box" id="58cc6e8ffbe4132051a4caf97248d5d2" label="mixed materials [A0000000079660]" type="box">10</container><container id="768b1c6dc800faae0b740ecd3d4ccc58" parent="58cc6e8ffbe4132051a4caf97248d5d2" type="folder">136</container></did></c><c id="73638e610c23394b3aef18721bf70b90" level="file"><did><unittitle>Clippings: Tunisia Government budget</unittitle><unitdate normal="1969/1969">1969</unitdate><container altrender="Legal Document Box" id="df5abd12a0b12ee2e351124bfefd7cc2" label="mixed materials [A0000000079660]" type="box">10</container><container id="5eb01ad65f8a7dabaa4fd450b48402ba" parent="df5abd12a0b12ee2e351124bfefd7cc2" type="folder">137</container></did></c><c id="3e10f9853426d78c8864566079beeb59" level="file"><did><unittitle>Clippings: General</unittitle><unitdate normal="1970/1971" type="inclusive">1970-1971</unitdate><container altrender="Legal Document Box" id="691a3a8b5605a179bd3f0ae4e25ac1bb" label="mixed materials [A0000000079661]" type="box">11</container><container id="fee7919754f4696d955c6684cfb1cae0" parent="691a3a8b5605a179bd3f0ae4e25ac1bb" type="folder">138</container></did></c><c id="5258f088c6da2ae899cf55a725fc0728" level="file"><did><unittitle>Clippings: Family planning and other topics</unittitle><unitdate normal="1964/1968" type="inclusive">1964-1968</unitdate><langmaterial id="299df223c275dc3dfe192267b3e6a4d6">Materials are predominately in French.

Nicholas H. Wright served as Population Council Resident Representative (also referred to as Resident Advisor) for the Ceylon Office from 1967 until the end of 1970. Correspondence, invoices, receipts, bank account statements, bills, and a limited number of ads document the business expenses Wright approved in relation to utility payments, equipment purchases, and supply imports for the Population Council Office at 33/7 De Fonseca Place, the residence bungalow at 15/7 Maitland Crescent, and the Family Planning Bureau office at 5 Bagatelle Road. Many files that contain these types of materials bear the name of the specific company or Ceylon Government Agency that issued or approved the particular services or products the files document. Others have titles that describe the specific material formats they contain such as bills or receipts. The subseries also includes a small group of personnel files for Secretary and Administrative Assistant Avril M. Jayawardene and other staff members, correspondence with Population Council and Ford Foundation officials in New York, and a collection of Population Council Board of Trustees and Executive Committee meeting agendas. These meeting agendas consist of more than just subject items and instead include descriptions and summaries of developments and plans within the organization. It appears that for every assembly of the Board of Trustees or Executive Committee, the Population Council may have distributed a meeting agenda copy to each of its regional offices.</p>

<p>A smaller group of records documents the Ceylon Office's statistical work and collaborative family planning program efforts. Wright, his staff, and his partner organizations generally collected statistics to study the use of contraceptives within the Ceylon population, the availability and use of family planning services and clinics within the country, and the demographic background information of family planning acceptors. The subseries contains correspondence, reports, tables, sample surveys, and clinical forms that provide evidence of this work. Drafts and notes are housed with many of these reports and tables. The Population Council Office in Ceylon chiefly worked with the Ceylon Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Swedish International Development Authority (SIDA – present day Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency) on family planning projects. Several files contain materials that discuss how the SIDA-sponsored Swedish-Ceylon Family Planning Program helped the Population Council in establishing its regional office in the country. The MOH Department of Health Services took over the Sweden-Ceylon Family Planning Program in 1968 and established the Family Planning Bureau. With help from the Population Council and SIDA, the Bureau sought to advance the National Family Planning Programme in Ceylon. Various types of reports and correspondence regard the progress and activities of the Bureau and the Population Council's work with it. Materials originating from the years 1969-1970 that concern the Bureau discuss an increasing political opposition to family planning work in Ceylon.</p>

<p>Staff dismissal letters in the personnel files indicate that in early 1971, the Population Council closed its regional office in Ceylon.</p>
