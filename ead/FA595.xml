<p>Michael Lipsky's material arrived at the RAC in four accessions between 2012 and 2019. </p><p>The material that arrived in 2012 was originally processed into two collections, FA595 and FA725. </p><p>FA725 was originally part of Accession 2012:064, a large accession of Ford papers that was broken into many discrete collections. The original box numbers associated with this collection were Boxes 43107, 43111, 43124-43129, 43138-43143, and 43308. FA725 contained correspondence, reports, and  state, city and project files. This collection was minimally processed and contained no series, file-level numbering, or biographical note. </p><p>FA595 originated from Accession 2012:044, another large accession that was broken into discrete collections. The collection's original box numbers were Boxes 48537-48543. FA595 contained four series: Correspondence, Program files (regional files and subject files), Innovations in State and Local Government files, and Program Related Investment (PRIs) and Finance Related Files. This collection was also minimally processed.
 
Two more accessions of Michael Lipsky's material arrived in 2019 as Accession 2019:144 (Box 42604) and Accession 2019:145 (Box 42605). Accession 2019:145 contained files related to the Innovations in State and Local Government awards and were added to Series 4. Accession 2019:144 was added to Series 6: Subject Files.</p>  </acqinfo>

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Michael Lipsky was a program officer at the Ford Foundation from 1991 until 2002. Between 1991 and 1995, Lipsky served as a program officer within the Ford Foundation's Governance and Public Policy unit. In 1996, after some restructuring at the Foundation, he was a program officer in the Peace and Social Justice within the Governance and Civil Society unit, and in 1997, he was promoted to Senior Program Officer. He left the Foundation in 2002. </p><p>One of Lipsky's primary responsibilities at the Foundation in the 1990s was organizing the Innovations in American Government program along with the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University and the Council for Excellence in Government in Washington, D.C. The objective of the program was to demonstrate that American governments are capable of responding creatively and effectively to critical social issues. Each winning program received a Foundation grant of $100,000 to disseminate information about the program and encourage its replication. In 1995, the Foundation expanded the number of $100,000 awards to 15 and began honoring federal Innovations as well. The program was renamed Innovations in American Government at this time. Lipsky also worked on a similar program, the Partnership for Trust in Government. Founded in 1997, the Partnership convened 36 major American corporations, nonprofits and media organizations to promote the importance and accomplishments of government of the American people. The Partnership was managed by the Council for Excellence in Government. Lipsky was also involved in adapting the model of the Innovations program for government grantees in Brazil, the Philippines, South Africa, Chile, and Native American nations. </p><p>In addition to these activities, Lipsky was active in carrying out the State Fiscal Analysis Initiative. At the time of his involvement, SFAI was a network of 22 state-based organizations and several national nonprofits that produced timely and accessible state tax budget analysis in order to improve outcomes for low-income and other vulnerable populations. A similar program supported by Lipsky's work was Collaborations that Count, an eleven-state initiative in the South and Northwest to improve the ability of grassroots organizations to work together on a common agenda, and to work more effectively with policy analysis organizations. Lipsky also helped administer the Budget and Fiscal Analysis Network. In collaboration with the International Budget Project of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities of Washington, D.C., program officers and grantees of the Foundation's overseas offices worked to advance budget transparency and accountability worldwide. Before leaving the Foundation, Lipsky worked to establish Leadership for a Changing World, a program to recognize and celebrate the contributions of community leaders in the United States. The first awards took place in 2001.</p><p>Before joining the Ford Foundation as a program officer in 1991, Lipsky was a temporary assistant in the Public Affairs Program at the Ford Foundation in 1965, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin, and a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1969-1991. He is known for writing Street-Level Bureaucracy, first published in 1980. Lipsky defined street-level bureaucrats as "public service workers who interact directly with citizens in the course of their jobs, and who have substantial discretion in the execution of their work." </p><p>After leaving the Foundation, Lipsky was senior program director of Demos, a non-partisan public policy research and advocacy organization, and an affiliate professor at Georgetown University.</p>  </bioghist>

<p>The Ford Foundation's Governance and Public Policy Program (GPP) operated during the early to mid-1990s. It oversaw grants for programs and projects involved with citizen participation and electoral politics, policy think tanks and interdisciplinary approaches to economic and social policy, improving state and local government, increasing the number of minorities in the public policy field, and philanthropy and the nonprofit sector. GPP grantees included the Woodrow Wilson Program, the Innovations in American Government Awards Program, and the Public Agenda Foundation among many others. Jan Jaffe served as Acting Director for the program during a transition period between 1992 and 1993. June Zeitlin then became Director in 1993 and continued to lead the program when it transitioned to become the Governance and Civil Society Program in 1996. The Governance and Civil Society program's overarching goals were to improve governmental performance and accountability, find new approaches to implement public policies, and enhance the role of civic organizations in promoting democratic values.</p>  </bioghist>

Foundation and the Annie E. Casey Foundation to create the State Fiscal Analysis Initiative. The State Fiscal Analysis Initiative (SFAI) was created in response to social welfare responsibilities shifting from the national government to state and local governments. SFAI was a collaborative funding effort to empower state-level nonprofit organizations to undertake credible, timely and understandable analysis of critical budget and tax issues and inform the public on these matters. The Ford Foundation provided nearly half of the national foundation support for this initiative, which concluded in 2002. The grants supported research, policy analysis, public education and coalition building. Initially, grants averaged $100,000 annually for each state budget analysis project. The selected nonprofit affiliates were committed to addressing how budget issues were affecting low-income and disadvantaged groups in their states. SFAI supported 11 groups in 1993 to having affiliated policy groups in 29 states and the District of Columbia.</p><p>SFAI grantees:</p><p>Alabama Arise </p><p>Arizona Children's Action's

Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, initiated an awards program on Innovations in State and Local Government. The objective of the program was to demonstrate that American governments are capable of responding creatively and effectively to critical social issues. Each winning program received a Foundation grant of $100,00 to disseminate information about the program and encourage its replication. From 1986 until 1995 (with a hiatus in 1989), the awards honored ten states, cities, counties, and tribal or public authorities for exemplary innovative programs. In 1995, the Foundation expanded the number of $100,000 awards from ten to 15 and began honoring federal Innovations as well. The program was renamed Innovations in American Government at this time and began partnering with the Council for Excellence in Government.</p><p>The Foundation undertook a variety of outreach activities in support of the Innovations Program. It hired a public relations firm to disseminate information about award-winners, finalists, and semi-finalists, and to promote awareness of the program in the popular media and trade press. It sponsored a program booklet to publicize Innovations programs. The ceremony was held in D.C. beginning in 1993. Between 1993 and 1998, Vice President Albert Gore participated in the event.</p></bioghist><c id="185792439bd14557bbc85570af41b9c1" level="file"><did><unittitle>Innovations in State and Local Government Awards Program -
