      <head>Processing Information</head>
      <p>These papers of the Study for the Ford Foundation on Policy and Program cover the years 1947 (1948-1950) to 1956, and consist primarily of correspondence, reports and drafts. The correspondence and reports were sent to the Archives with the Office of the President Papers of H. Rowan Gaither (President of the Ford Foundation from 1953 to 1956). The correspondence and reports, however, were created dur1ng Mr. Gaither's Chairmanship of the Study Committee from 1948 to 1950. For this reason these two collections were processed separately.</p>
      <p>It was decided to combine the correspondence and reports with a number of drafts and summaries of the Committee's Report, which were discovered in the Archives and which may well have come from Mr. Gaither's office as well.</p>
      <p>At a later date, additional Study Committee material, from the years 1948 to 1951, was found in the Archives, and was integrated into these files. It does not appear that this material came from Mr. Gaither's office, but from the offices of other Committee members.</p>

      <head>Sketch of the Committee</head>
      <p>"In the Fall of 1948, anticipating final settlement of Federal Estate Tax matters and the probable receipt during 1949 and 1950 of income sufficient to permit the Foundation to undertake a greatly expanded program, a Study Committee was appointed to act as independent consultants to the Foundation. This committee was made up of men widely known and respected in such fields as education, public health, the natural sciences, political science, the social sciences, the humanities, and modern business and industry. Members of the study Committee were Mr. H. Rowan Gaither Jr., Chairman; Thomas H. Carroll, D.C.S.; Charles C. Lauritsen, Ph.D; William C. DeVane, Ph.D; Donald G. Marquis, Ph.D; T. Duckett Jones, M.D.; Peter H. Odegard, Ph.D; Francis T. Spaulding, Ed.D.
A Staff directed by Mr. Gaither served the Committee and included Mr. William McPeak and Mr. Dyke Brown, Assistant Directors; Mr. Paul Bixler; and Mr. Don K. Price."
..."The Study Committee agreed at the outset that the purpose of the study was not to accumulate a comprehensive catalogue of projects which the Foundation might undertake, but to block out in general terms those critical areas where problems were most serious and where the Foundation might make the most significant contributions to human welfare."
(from Report to the Trustees, October 1950, pp. 3-4, 5)</p>
      <p>"The work of the Study Committee was concluded in November 1949, when its General Report containing the Committee's conclusions and recommendations was submitted to the Trustees. ... Publication of the Report was authorized by special action of the Trustees on September 6, 1950."
(from the preface of the General Report, p. 11)</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>This collection is made up of two series: Series I contains the working papers of the Study for the Ford Foundation on Policy and Program, and Series II consists of drafts and summaries of the Committee's Report as well as some Report-related material.</p>
      <p>"The Report of the study for the Ford Foundatlon on Policy and Program" was published in September 1950. This report proposed five program areas to be the focal points of the Ford Foundation's operations. The published report was comprised of four volumes: volume I, the General Report; volumes II and III, Committee and Division Reports; and volume IV, Staff Memoranda.</p>
      <p>The material in these papers covers the years 1947 (1948-1950) to 1956 and consists of six boxes of notes, intercommittee memoranda, correspondence, proposals, reports, summaries and drafts. Minutes of several Ford Foundation Trustee meetings are also included in the papers. While the collection contains many documents that are duplicated in the final report, it also includes original material that chronicles the methods of the study, the development, and the publicatlon of the Committee's Report. It also contains some material which pertains to the policy and program decisions published in the Report.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, these papers provide a background for the Committee's Report, but do not stand as a substitute. For a complete accounting of the workings and findings of the Committee, the researcher should address himself to the four volumes of the "Report of Study for the Ford Foundation on Policy and Program."</p>

          <head>Scope and Contents</head>
          <p>The papers in Series I document the overall operation of the Committee and the fundamental decisions that were made by its members regarding the formulation of program disciplines, trustee selection, and the coordination and executlon of the study itself. The modus operandi of the group was to solicit suggestions from people not formally connected to the Study. The papers include correspondence among Committee members and individuals outside the committee. This correspondence demonstrates the wealth of ideas regarding policy and program that were submmitted to the Committee for consideration. Included among the correspondence are numerous proposals, sollcited and unsolicited, suggesting policy and program areas. Also included in this series are skeletal reports, drafted midway through the study, by the following Committee members: Thomas H. Carroll, Charles C. Lauritsen, Donald G. Marquis, T. Duckett Jones and Peter H. Odegard.</p>
          <p>With respect to the functioning of the Ford Foundation, the papers address two issues: the tax status of a philanthropic institution, and a code of by-laws for the administration of such an establishment.</p>

          <head>Arrangement</head>
          <p>Series I consists of 2 linear feet of material. The folders had no obvious arrangement scheme to begin with, and so they were regrouped into clusters of similar topics or materials: inter-committee memoranda, correspondence and proposals among committee and non-committee members, the development of the Study Committee Report, skeletal reports by Committee members, the Foundation's tax status and by-laws, and trustee materials. Within each folder the material ls arranged chronologically. However, the correspondence and proposals among committee and non-committee members are arranged alphabetlcally within each folder. It should be noted that in the latter material, for the year 1948, there is no H - R correspondence. Also, all items marked "miscellaneous - no author" were filed in the beginning of the "A" folder.</p>
