      <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
      <p>John C. Bugher (1901-1970) was born in Upland, Indiana. He received his B.S. degree from Taylor University in Upland in 1921. From the University of Michigan he received the following degrees: in 1921, an A.B.; in 1929, an M.D.; and in 1931, an M.S. From 1919-1920, Dr. Bugher served as Instructor in Mathematics and Physics at Taylor University; from March 1926-1928, he was Director of Public Health at South Haven, Michigan; and from 1922 until 1937 he was on the faculty of the University of Michigan, first as Assistant in Bacteriology from 1922-1926, then as Senior Instructor in Pathology from 1929-1932, and finally as Assistant Professor of Pathology from 1933 to 1937, when he resigned to join the Rockefeller Foundation.</p>
      <p>His first two months with the Foundation, from October to December 1937, Dr. Bugher spent in the Foundation's Yellow Fever Laboratories in New York City, becoming familiar with current yellow fever research and techniques prior to an assignment to Colombia, South America. At the end of December he left for Colombia to participate in the laboratory and field investigations in yellow fever being carried on there. During his last three years in Columbia (1940-1943), he served as Director of the Seccion de Estudios Especiales. From October 1943 until October 1948, Dr. Bugher's headquarters were in Lagos, Nigeria, West Africa, where he established the Yellow Fever Institute and served as its Director. Here research in yellow fever, including jungle yellow fever, was carried on, involving not only laboratory studies, but field operations in the forest and other areas of that part of Africa. Upon Dr. Bugher's return to the United States, he was again assigned to the Foundation's laboratories, where his particular responsibilities were the biophysical studies of viruses from January 1949 until March 1951.</p>
      <p>He was then granted a leave of absence by the Foundation to become Deputy Director of the Division of Biology and Medicine of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission from 1951-1952, and then Director from 1952 until 1955. In April 1955, Dr. Bugher returned to active duty with the Rockefeller Foundation and was Director for Medical Education and Public Health from then until April 1959, when he was appointed Consultant on Nuclear Energy Affairs. From April to the end of September 1955, the effective date of Dr. Bugher's resignation from the Atomic Energy Commission, he carried dual Foundation and AEC responsibilities.</p>
      <p>While with the Atomic Energy Commission, Dr. Bugher participated in the testing of various fission and thermonuclear devices, leading to improved weapons; and was in close touch with research activities in the biological sciences and closely associated with and responsible for many of the developments connected with the peaceful uses of atomic energy in the medical field. In the summer of 1955, Dr. Bugher went to Geneva, Switzerland, as an official adviser to the United States Delegation to the First International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy. He also attended the Second International Conference in Geneva, in September 1958.</p>
      <p>Dr. Bugher was a member of various committees in the field of atomic energy, including the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission's Advisory Committee for Biology and Medicine, of which he was appointed Vice Chairman in January 1959 and Chairman in June 1960; the Committee on Atomic Bomb Casualties and the Committee on Pathological Effects of Atomic Radiation of the National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council; the National Committee on Radiation Protection and Measurements; the By-Laws and Rules Committee and the Nominating Committee of American Nuclear Society, of which he was also a member of the Board of Directors; the American Public Health Association Program Area Committee on Radiological Health; Brookhaven National Laboratory (Associated Universities, Inc.) Medical Department Visiting Committee - elected Chairman in May,1960; Committee on New Frontiers of Technology of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce; Health Physics Advisory Board; Mayor's (New York City) Technical Advisory Committee on Radiation, of which he was Chairman; New York State's General Advisory Committee on Atomic Energy; University of Michigan Law School Atomic Energy Advisory Committee; the World Health Organization Panel on Radiation, and the Puerto Rico Nuclear Center Medical Advisory Committee.</p>
      <p>Dr. Bugher was also a member of the National Institute for Disaster Mobilization, Inc., and the New York City Health Research Advisory Council.</p>
      <p>His membership in scientific societies included the Academy of Political Science; Federation of American Societies for Experimental Pathology and Experimental Biology; American Association of Pathologists and Bacteriologists; the Michigan Pathological Society; the American Cancer Society; the American Association of Cancer Research; the American Medical Association; the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene; the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine; the Royal Geographical Society; the American Public Health Association; the Health Physics Society; the American Nuclear Society; the Radiation Research Society; the New York Academy of Sciences, the honorary societies of Alpha Omega Alpha and Sigma Xi. At the University of Michigan, he was a member of the Gamma Alpha Sigma and Phi Rho Sigma fraternities.</p>
      <p>During Dr. Bugher's services with the Foundation and the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, he received various honors, including the award from the President of Colombia in 1943 of the Cruz de Boyaca, and life and honorary membership in the Academy of Medicine of Bogota, Colombia; the bestowal on him in 1948 of the Commander of the Order of the British Empire; the honorary degree of Sc.D. from Taylor University in 1953; the presentation on September 20, 1955, by Chairman Lewis Strauss of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission's Distinguished Service Award and Superior Accomplishment Award; the receipt on May 9, 1956, of the Howard Taylor Ricketts' Award at the University of Chicago, and the Alumnus of the Y ear Award for 1956, from Taylor University on June 1, 1956. In December 1958, Dr. Bugher was made an Honorary Member of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Chile in Santiago. He was unanimously elected a Fellow of The New York Academy of Sciences on December 3, 1959, in "outstanding recognition for scientific achievement and promotion of Science."</p>
