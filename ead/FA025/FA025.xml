    <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
<p>Charles Emory Culpeper (1874-1940) was born in Rome, Georgia, to a farm family of nine children. Although he never finished high school, he was an industrious young man who worked as a store clerk in the Rome area and later as a traveling salesman. In 1899, Culpeper accepted a job selling Coca-Cola syrup to soda fountains in Philadelphia. In 1904, he was transferred to New York, where he worked as a salesman for the Coca-Cola Bottling Works of Newark and of New York. In 1917, Culpeper bought the two companies for $160,000 and combined them into the Coca-Cola Bottling Company of New York. The company prospered under his direction, and at the time of his death in 1940, his stock in it comprised the bulk of his substantial fortune.</p><p>Culpeper was highly involved in the welfare of children. Throughout his lifetime, he was instrumental in assisting boys' clubs in the New York area. In his will, Culpeper directed that a foundation be established to acquire the bulk of his fortune and conserve it for the benefit of future generations. On December 18, 1940, the Charles E. Culpeper Foundation was established.</p><p>By the late 1980s, the foundation focused its awards in medical science on three areas within the health care system: research, medical education, and clinical services. In 1990, Culpeper Foundation assets totaled approximately $118 million, and it reported disbursements of $6 million in grants that year. In 1999, the Culpeper Foundation merged with the Rockefeller Brothers Fund. A significant portion of the grants the foundation awarded were made during the period 1977-1992. The program also addressed the impact of advances in medical technology and the evolving field of managed care in a changing health care environment, as well as its effect upon individualized patient care. In 1992, support for new information technologies extended program development at secondary schools and offered technical training support for school faculty to develop foreign language curricula.</p><p>From 1993 onward, grants were issued in four broad categories: administration of justice; arts and culture; education; and health. At the college level, the foundation continued to fund computer literacy programs it had supported since the 1980s, and it extended its support to applied technologies in the humanities and social sciences as well. In 1999, the Charles E. Culpeper Foundation closed its offices in Stamford, Connecticut, and transferred its remaining operations to the Rockefeller Brothers Fund in New York City. The Brothers Fund has continued to administer remaining grant contracts and has also awarded additional grants under the terms of the merger agreement. By the end of 2007, all scheduled grants were to be satisfied; the Medical Scholars program continued until around 2010.</p>  </bioghist>

Mr. Culpeper's story was in the vein of a thrilling rags to riches adventure story. He was raised on a farm near Rome, and although he never finished high school, he was an industrious young man who began his career as a country store clerk and later worked as the manager of an all-night restaurant in the newspaper district of Philadelphia.</p><p>Charles E. Culpeper joined the Coca-Cola Company in 1899 at its Philadelphia plant, selling syrup to soda fountains in the city. He was subsequently transferred to Baltimore, and in 1904, he was transferred to the New York branch, where he continued to work as a salesman. In New York City, Mr. Culpeper established Coca-Cola fountain accounts. Two assistants accompanied him so that the trio could transport sacks containing Coca-Cola trays, glasses, and other brand items. 'Charlie,' as he was known to all, was reported by friends, family, and employees alike, as having an enthusiastic and winning personality, characterized by his generosity and his ability to befriend all those he encountered. He was known for his devotion to work efforts through his wit and enthusiasm and established a close relationship with Asa S. Candler, the Atlanta druggist who purchased the rights to the unique cola formula and began a successful marketing venture to distribute Coca-Cola. Although he began his tenure as a city salesman, Culpeper later became manager of the New York office and subsequently after a switch to the bottling field, became the company's manager of New York operations in New York, Brooklyn, and Newark, New Jersey.</p><p>In 1918, Charles E. Culpeper purchased the Coca-Cola Bottling Company of New York with his wife Daphne for approximately $160,000. Mr. Culpeper, as Chairman and President, and Mrs. Culpeper as Treasurer, chose to live in a rooftop apartment at the Bronx, New York plant during this period. Their realm of influence expanded the soft drink regional market to include suburban New York City areas and also extended to Buffalo, New York and Bridgeport, Connecticut in 1922.</p><p>Several important milestones were reached during Mr. Culpeper's company direction. In 1929, over 100,000 gallons of syrup were bottled, and in 1930, over 31,000 cases of Coca-Cola were sold in just one day. His efforts in the industry led to the introduction of the 'six-bottle open carton' developed in 1906, which gained widespread acceptance and use. He also successfully appealed to the Atlanta headquarters of the company to obtain a franchise; as a result of these negotiations in 1929, perpetual franchise was offered to all Coca-Cola bottlers.</p><p>Mr. Culpeper married Daphne Seybolt (February 4, 1891-September 21, 1976) in 1918, and they resided in Norwalk, Connecticut until his death on February 2, 1940. The couple had no children. At the timeof his death, the Coca-Cola Bottling Company of New York was one of the largest soft drink bottling companies worldwide. Culpeper's substantial fortune formed the basis of the Foundation possessing his name and derived from the success of this venture. Two funeral services were held: in New York City, at the Riverside Baptist Church, and at the First Baptist Church in Rome, Georgia. He is buried in the Culpeper family plot in Curryville, Georgia.</p><p>Mr. Culpeper was highly involved in the welfare of children. Throughout his lifetime, he was instrumental in assisting boys' clubs in the New York area. In his will, he directed that a foundation be established to acquire the bulk of his fortune and to conserve it for the benefit of future generations. On December 17, 1940, the Charles E. Culpeper Foundation was established under the last Will and Testament of Mr. Culpeper. After this time, Daphne Seybolt Culpeper assisted in directing the activities of the Charles E. Culpeper Foundation as its President until 1968; she also maintained an involvement in the bottling company until her death in 1976.</p><p>Institutional History</p><p>The Charles E. Culpeper Foundation, Inc. (Culpeper Foundation) was incorporated in the State of New York on December 18, 1940, as a not-for-profit corporation devoted to charitable giving for both religious and educational purposes, with particular emphasis upon future generations. The three trustees appointed to direct the Foundation were Clarence R. Avery, President of the Chattanooga Glass Company, James T. Murray, successor to Mr. Culpeper as president and chairman of the Company's board, and Mrs. Daphne Seybolt Culpeper, a director and vice president of the company at that time. The will directed that the net income from the trust fund held with the Coca-Cola Bottling Company of New York to establish this charitable venture, was valued at $8 million. James T. Murray, also an attorney, was officer and director of the Foundation from this time until November 1968, at which time Frank J. McNamara, Jr. was elected Chairman of the Board. Under the joint leadership of Mrs. Culpeper and Board President Murray, the distribution of grant monies was made according to personal guidelines. Monies during this time period were extended to numerous institutions in less significant amounts.</p><p>In 1990, Culpeper Foundation assets totaled approximately $118 million and reported disbursements of $6 million in grants that year. In 1999, the Culpeper Foundation merged with the Rockefeller Brothers Fund. A significant portion of grants awarded by the Foundation were made during the period 1977-1992. From 1993 onward, grants were issued in four broad categories: administration of justice, arts and culture, education, and health.</p><p>The Foundation's health care program was characterized by a focus upon improving clinical skills for physicians and to aid in the pursuit of the overlap between social and ethical issues in treating patients. The program also extended to concern for the impact of advances in medical technology and the evolving field of managed care in a changing health care environment, and its effect upon individualized patient care. By the late 1980s, the Foundation focused its awards in medical science to three areas within the health care system: research, medical education, and clinical services.</p><p>In 1992, the recognition to support new information technologies extended program development at secondary schools, offering technical training support to school faculty specifically in order to develop foreign language curricula. At the college level, the Foundation continued to support computer literacy programs since the 1980s and now recognized the need to apply technologies in the humanities and social sciences as well. Also during this time, funds were awarded to institutions supporting cultural endeavors including musical and dance performance, and cultural programs focusing on both social and natural history. Programs for disadvantaged youth and disabled citizens were also supported. These interests were represented by support of the National Theatre of the Deaf, Blind Musicians, National Theatre Workshop of the Handicapped, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where a program was developed to serve challenged museum patrons. Patronage also extended to the preservation of information, to include the reprinting of the out-of-print collection of 'Benjamin Franklin's Papers.'</p><p>In 1999, the Charles E. Culpeper Foundation closed its offices in Stamford, Connecticut, and the remaining Foundation operations were transferred to the Rockefeller Brothers Fund in New York City. The Brothers Fund has continued to administer remaining grant contracts and has also awarded additional grants under the auspices of the agreement arranged. By the end of the year 2007, all grants scheduled will have been satisfied; the Medical Scholars program continues as of this writing.</p></bioghist><arrangement id="375caed8ebb95a4224af7bcc70d09780"><head>Arrangement note</head><p>Accession 1 records are arranged in four series:</p><p>Series 1 - Administration</p><p>Series 2 - Grants</p><p>Series 3 - Historical Files</p><p>Series 4 - Francis J.

Sketch</p><p>Charles Emory Culpeper, born on May 11, 1874 in Rome, Georgia, was the son of a Baptist minister and one of nine children. Mr. Culpeper's story was in the vein of a thrilling rags to riches adventure story. He was raised on a farm near Rome, and although he never finished high school, he was an industrious young man who began his career as a country store clerk and later worked as the manager of an all-night restaurant in the newspaper district of Philadelphia.</p><p>Charles E. Culpeper joined the Coca-Cola Company in 1899 at its Philadelphia plant, selling syrup to soda fountains in the city. He was subsequently transferred to Baltimore, and in 1904, he was transferred to the New York branch, where he continued to work as a salesman. In New York City, Mr. Culpeper established Coca-Cola fountain accounts. Two assistants accompanied him so that the trio could transport sacks containing Coca-Cola trays, glasses, and other brand items. 'Charlie,' as he was known to all, was reported by friends, family, and employees alike, as having an enthusiastic and winning personality, characterized by his generosity and his ability to befriend all those he encountered. He was known for his devotion to work efforts through his wit and enthusiasm and established a close relationship with Asa S. Candler, the Atlanta druggist who purchased the rights to the unique cola formula and began a successful marketing venture to distribute Coca-Cola. Although he began his tenure as a city salesman, Culpeper later became manager of the New York office and subsequently after a switch to the bottling field, became the company's manager of New York operations in New York, Brooklyn, and Newark, New Jersey.</p><p>In 1918, Charles E. Culpeper purchased the Coca-Cola Bottling Company of New York with his wife Daphne for approximately $160,000. Mr. Culpeper, as Chairman and President, and Mrs. Culpeper as Treasurer, chose to live in a rooftop apartment at the Bronx, New York plant during this period. Their realm of influence expanded the soft drink regional market to include suburban New York City areas and also extended to Buffalo, New York and Bridgeport, Connecticut in 1922.</p><p>Several important milestones were reached during Mr. Culpeper's company direction. In 1929, over 100,000 gallons of syrup were bottled, and in 1930, over 31,000 cases of Coca-Cola were sold in just one day. His efforts in the industry led to the introduction of the 'six-bottle open carton' developed in 1906, which gained widespread acceptance and use. He also successfully appealed to the Atlanta headquarters of the company to obtain a franchise; as a result of these negotiations in 1929, perpetual franchise was offered to all Coca-Cola bottlers.</p><p>Mr. Culpeper married Daphne Seybolt (February 4, 1891-September 21, 1976) in 1918, and they resided in Norwalk, Connecticut until his death on February 2, 1940. The couple had no children. At the timeof his death, the Coca-Cola Bottling Company of New York was one of the largest soft drink bottling companies worldwide. Culpeper's substantial fortune formed the basis of the Foundation possessing his name and derived from the success of this venture. Two funeral services were held: in New York City, at the Riverside Baptist Church, and at the First Baptist Church in Rome, Georgia. He is buried in the Culpeper family plot in Curryville, Georgia.</p><p>Mr. Culpeper was highly involved in the welfare of children. Throughout his lifetime, he was instrumental in assisting boys' clubs in the New York area. In his will, he directed that a foundation be established to acquire the bulk of his fortune and to conserve it for the benefit of future generations. On December 17, 1940, the Charles E. Culpeper Foundation was established under the last Will and Testament of Mr. Culpeper. After this time, Daphne Seybolt Culpeper assisted in directing the activities of the Charles E. Culpeper Foundation as its President until 1968; she also maintained an involvement in the bottling company until her death in 1976.</p><p>Institutional History</p><p>The Charles E. Culpeper Foundation, Inc. (Culpeper Foundation) was incorporated in the State of New York on December 18, 1940, as a not-for-profit corporation devoted to charitable giving for both religious and educational purposes, with particular emphasis upon future generations. The three trustees appointed to direct the Foundation were Clarence R. Avery, President of the Chattanooga Glass Company, James T. Murray, successor to Mr. Culpeper as president and chairman of the Company's board, and Mrs. Daphne Seybolt Culpeper, a director and vice president of the company at that time. The will directed that the net income from the trust fund held with the Coca-Cola Bottling Company of New York to establish this charitable venture, was valued at $8 million. James T. Murray, also an attorney, was officer and director of the Foundation from this time until November 1968, at which time Frank J. McNamara, Jr. was elected Chairman of the Board. Under the joint leadership of Mrs. Culpeper and Board President Murray, the distribution of grant monies was made according to personal guidelines. Monies during this time period were extended to numerous institutions in less significant amounts. A detailed listing of the characteristics of the Foundation's grant program can be found in Series 2, Annual Reports, specifically in the "50th Anniversary Report, 1940-1990."</p><p>In 1990, Culpeper Foundation assets totaled approximately $118 million and reported disbursements of $6 million in grants that year. In 1999, the Culpeper Foundation merged with the Rockefeller Brothers Fund. A significant portion of grants awarded by the Foundation were made during the period 1977-1992. From 1993 onward, grants were issued in four broad categories: administration of justice, arts and culture, education, and health.</p><p>The Foundation's health care program was characterized by a focus upon improving clinical skills for physicians and to aid in the pursuit of the overlap between social and ethical issues in treating patients. The program also extended to concern for the impact of advances in medical technology and the evolving field of managed care in a changing health care environment, and its effect upon individualized patient care. By the late 1980s, the Foundation focused its awards in medical science to three areas within the health care system: research, medical education, and clinical services.</p><p>In 1992, the recognition to support new information technologies extended program development at secondary schools, offering technical training support to school faculty specifically in order to develop foreign language curricula. At the college level, the Foundation continued to support computer literacy programs since the 1980s and now recognized the need to apply technologies in the humanities and social sciences as well. Also during this time, funds were awarded to institutions supporting cultural endeavors including musical and dance performance, and cultural programs focusing on both social and natural history. Programs for disadvantaged youth and disabled citizens were also supported. These interests were represented by support of the National Theatre of the Deaf, Blind Musicians, National Theatre Workshop of the Handicapped, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where a program was developed to serve challenged museum patrons. Patronage also extended to the preservation of information, to include the reprinting of the out-of-print collection of 'Benjamin Franklin's Papers.'</p><p>In 1999, the Charles E. Culpeper Foundation closed its offices in Stamford, Connecticut, and the remaining Foundation operations were transferred to the Rockefeller Brothers Fund in New York City. The Brothers Fund has continued to administer remaining grant contracts and has also awarded additional grants under the auspices of the agreement arranged. By the end of the year 2007, all grants scheduled will have been satisfied; the Medical Scholars program continues as of this writing.</p></bioghist><scopecontent id="e7ddd3ddc05bc317424f42d2db9e5173"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>Correspondents include: Philip M.

These composite Anniversary Reports were at the time deemed satisfactory for organizational reporting requirements according to the Tax Reform Act of 1969. The Foundation distributed its first report in 1975.</p><p>The anniversary reports, considered out-of-date by the time of publication, were therefore thought to be of limited value to recipients or even misleading. In 1993, a Biennial Report was produced covering the years 1991-1992. After this time, the Trustees determined that the Foundation should produce a report annually. The annual publication of reports continued from 1993 until 1998. The publication of a final "Retrospective" covered the time span from the inception of the Foundation's operations in 1940 to the terminus of the Foundation's activities as an independent philanthropy in 1999.</p><p>The Trustees' goal was to provide these reports as a tool for potential grantees to determine the applicability of established Foundation programs to satisfy their grant needs. Published program guidelines brochures were considered supplementary to these reports, as were several additional published reports including "Adventurous Teachers, Excellent Schools" by Thomas James and "A Review of the Library Automation Program" by Ellen Arrick. These reports are also available in bound format in the Archive Center's library collection.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="40e8714358ee3c63d6d9efb0031b3a19"><head>Arrangement note</head><p>Series

Prior to 1980, the Foundation devoted approximately five percent of its grant program to support programs in this area. Support focused upon alternate dispute resolution, education of judges, judicial-congressional relations, educating the public regarding the operation of the judicial system, and addressing problems in the administration of criminal justice. One of the major recipients of Foundation grants in this category was the Governance Institute of Washington, D.C. One hallmark project funded was entitled "Challenges to the Legal Profession," which sought to develop a procedure to encourage a more humanistic approach in the profession, as well as to develop a consensus about lawyers' ethical obligations and responsibilities to society.</p><p>During the 1990s, the objectives of this program shifted to focus more specifically upon problems affecting the general public in the workings of the criminal justice system. Programs addressed the need for an informed citizenry to participate in effecting changes in law enforcement, and focused, particularly, on how to maximize results in the prevention and reduction of violent crime. The Administration of Justice grants program was terminated in 1997.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="10c5298b6b262c42799069d5b7a8be55"><head>Arrangement note</head><p>Series 3.1 is arranged

established to recognize the needs of private secondary school students without financial resources and to provide them the opportunity to attend these institutions. The support to private schools aimed to expand the student base beyond the traditionally financially elite. Educators at these institutions benefited from sabbaticals to pursue curriculum development and other incentives that helped schools retain qualified but overworked and underpaid instructors. Materials relating to these grants are found in Series 3.4.5.</p><p>The Charles E. Culpeper Fellowships in the social sciences were an important part of the assistance extended to individuals to provide full support for a post-doctoral student in the social sciences with particular emphasis on public policy studies. The Foundation also supported undergraduate education in the liberal arts and sciences at undergraduate private institutions and library technology in its pioneering stages.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="36a1aaf118657336eb1e3396bfcb6e6a"><head>Arrangement note</head><p>Series 3.4 is arranged in five sub-subseries:</p><p>Sub-subseries 1 - Education, General

care organizations, medical education, medical research, and medical humanities. A variety of direct care, research, and academic institutions were targeted to contribute to the established goals of hospital and community health care organizations, as well as to focus upon the research efforts of health professionals and scientists. Proposals which supported the individual missions of health care institutions were considered, in addition to the competitive scholarships sponsored in the medical humanities, research, and scientific investigations.</p><p>The Scholars in Medical Science Program, documented in Series 3.7.4, began operation in 1983 and sought to assist physician scientists to allow a division of their time between clinical practice, teaching, and biomedical research. The belief that simultaneous research and teaching activities would strengthen the skills of physician scientists contributed to the support of this successful program.</p></scopecontent><arrangement

greater involvement in research activities for younger physician scientists. The Culpeper Scholarships in Medical Science were offered for a term of three years through competitive application, to promote the research and progress of academic physicians. Annual applications were accepted for the four-year period 1987-1990, with one application allowed per institution. Up to three awards of $100,000 per year for up to three years could be awarded.</p><p>An independent Scientific Advisory Committee, composed of seven physician scientists, selected the scholars. Charles E. Culpeper Scholars represented research activities in neuroscience, genetics, immunology, and molecular biology. Between 1988 and 1999, the Foundation provided research awards totaling $11 million to promote the activities of young physician scientists.</p><p>The Visiting Professorships Awards were offered for a five-year period to individuals from an institution other than the applicant's affiliation. The Award was rotated annually among the departments of Medicine, Surgery, Pediatrics, Radiology/Radiotherapy, and Immunology/Genetics.</p></scopecontent><arrangement

Culpeper, and her extended family members and friends. Daphne, who eventually became the chairman of the Coca-Cola Bottling Company of New York in her husband's place, was the daughter of a Pennsylvania farmer. She married Charles E. Culpeper in 1918 in Pennsylvania; a second marriage ceremony was held in New York in 1920. Both marriage certificates are included in this series.</p><p>Personal letters include correspondence from some of Daphne's family and domestic staff who cared for her father in Pennsylvania. Some of the Seybolt and Sperl family relationships are described here. John and Susan Mornington were Daphne Seybolt's maternal grandparents. Elberta L. Seybolt Clauson was Daphne Seybolt's mother. George L. Clauson was Daphne Seybolt's step-father; George Claussen (b. June 22, 1861), alternate spelling 'Clauson,' was Elberta L. Seybolt's second husband. Hortense Rich served as caretaker to George Claussen, Daphne's step-father. Daphne Seybolt Culpeper married her second husband, George W. Sperl, and lived in the Wolfpit Road house in Connecticut. Augustus Sperl was possibly Daphne Seybolt (Culpeper) Sperl's father-in-law.</p><p>Other unusual correspondence was written to Mrs. Culpeper from a friend of Jewish descent, Florence Wise, writing from France during World War II. Ms. Wise discussed the difficulties sustained operating a business in Europe at that time. The post-war fate of this individual however, is not further related.</p><p>Although there is little information to be gleaned about the personal interests and temperament of either Charles or Daphne Culpeper in these records, Mr. and Mrs. Culpeper's interests of a humanitarian intent may be inferred from the newspaper article herein which notes the Culpepers' involvement in tracing the culprit in a fatal hit-and-run accident. While driving in upper Manhattan, the Culpepers pursued a "Corbalis Coupe forty-six blocks to one hundred and sixty-second street," where the alleged offender was arrested. This act of kindness resulted in a significant monetary award to the widow of the victim of the accident following court proceedings.</p><p>Daphne Culpeper purchased property in Norwalk, Connecticut, in the mid-1940s after Mr. Culpeper's death. This cottage was to remain her home for the rest of her life. The grounds of this estate on either side of Silvermine Avenue included a red colonial structure and barn across the street, as well as a green barn and additional acreage to the west of the cottage. Known as the 'pink house' to her staff, it is rumored that Mrs. Culpeper did not live in this house for many years, and that during that time, the estate was used primarily for the purpose of entertaining and hosting weekend retreats. The home, including a wine cellar, was said to contain some unusual décor on the second floor of the building. Local tradesmen claim that Mrs. Culpeper spent her later years living alone in this house, allowing the formal landscape to deteriorate.</p><p>Series 4 original materials have been retained. These materials have not been microfilmed.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="7c96a3d6cb71fdc56dc85eb15397b388"><head>Arrangement note</head><p>Series 4 is arranged in five subseries:</p><p>Subseries 1 - The Charles E.
