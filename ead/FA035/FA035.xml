      <p>Jackson Davis (1882-1947) was born in Cumberland County, Virginia, and attended the College of William and Mary.  He received a Master of Arts degree from Columbia University in 1908, and an LL.D. from the University of Richmond in 1930.  Beginning his career in education soon after graduating from William and Mary, his first position was that of school principal in Williamsburg.  After a year he moved to Roanoake where he was assistant secretary of the YMCA, a group he had joined in his undergraduate days.  In 1904 he was again a school principal, this time in Marion, Virginia.  The following year he accepted a position as superintendent of schools for Henrico County, Virginia.  In 1909 Mr. Davis became a member of the Board of Examiners and Inspectors for the Virginia State Board of Education.</p>
      <p>Negro and rural education were interests to which Jackson Davis devoted much of his life.  In 1909 he accepted a position as state agent for Negro rural schools in Virginia, which he held until he became a general field agent for the General Education Board in 1915.  He became assistant director in 1929 and associate director in 1933.  In addition, he was also a trustee of the Phelps-Stokes Fund.</p>
      <p>Interested in education on an international scale as well, Mr. Davis served as secretary of the International Education Board from 1923-1938.  He was a Carnegie visitor to Africa in 1935 and a member of the Committee on Interracial Cooperation, the Advisory Committee on Education in Liberia, and president of the board of trustees of the Booker Washington Institute, Liberia.</p>
      <p>Outside of his professional interests in education, Mr. Davis was a member of the Virginia Academy of Science and the Virginia Historical Society.  A contributor to many education journals, he was a joint author of "Africa Advancing," 1945.</p>
