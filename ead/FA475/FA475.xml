    <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
<p>Established in 1958 by Jackson Hole Preserve Inc., the American Conservation Association (ACA) was designed to carry on the educational, research, and citizen action activities that the Preserve felt was beyond its own capabilities. The ACA has supplied vital finances and leadership for initiatives to protect the park, refuge, forest, and recreation resources in this country. ACA's efforts to educate the public and secure its support have often been seminal to the establishment of important environmental and conservation organizations.</p>  </bioghist>
