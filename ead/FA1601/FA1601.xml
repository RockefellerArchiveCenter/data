    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This collection documents official activities by Nelson A. Rockefeller and his offices and staff in the execution of his duties as governor of New York from 1959-1973. The actions, decisions, and exchanges of information or points of view documented here occurred in the course of proposing and implementing policies for the Rockefeller administrations, political campaigns, and/or Rockefeller's personal activities. However, unless a document is specifically addressed to or from Nelson A. Rockefeller, or is referred to in a document addressed to him, it should not be assumed he saw the document or was aware of its existence or substance. Furthermore, researchers should bear in mind that staff files may contain documents or drafts addressed to Rockefeller that were never shown to him.</p>  </scopecontent>
