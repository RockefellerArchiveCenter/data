      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>Daniel Kevles, a leading historian of science, then at the California Institute of Technology, conducted a series of interviews in the early 1980s as research for his book, "In the Name of Eugenics", first published in 1985.  As part of his project, he had interviewed 39 key medical, human, and molecular geneticists from the US and UK.  He selected these scientists, based on their involvement from the 1930s to 1950s, with the process to establish human and medical genetics on an epistemologically-sound footing, devoid of the class and race biases and the methodological flaws that had infused the study of human heredity during the heyday of the eugenics movement.  The interviewees included Alexander Bearn, Walter Bodmer, Barton Childs, Harry Harris, Patricia Jacobs, Joshua Lederberg, Jerome Lejeune, Victor McKusick, James R. Neel, Paul E. Polani, Laurence Snyder, and Arthur Steinberg.</p>
