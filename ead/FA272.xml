    <head>Arrangement</head>
<p>The William H. Whyte papers are divided into three series: 1. Projects and Research, 2. Personal, and 3. Audiovisual Materials.</p><p>The papers primarily remain in original order, as received. </p><p>Whyte grouped his files under various headings or categories, but in many cases the relationship between contents and heading is ambiguous or unapparent. A number of the files also carry whimsical titles, further complicating the task of appraising the contents. In processing Whyte's papers, files have been grouped under his designated headings, with only occasional slight modification of headings or titles for clarity. In a few cases, headings were added to improve order.</p><p>In navigating Whyte's papers, it is important to recognize the fluid nature of his categories, titles, and file contents. Materials relating to the same topic may be filed under different headings. For instance, materials relating to the "Street Life Project" are located not only in the Street Life Project section, but also among the Films (General), Lincoln Center, Pedestrian Flows, Plaza Film, Plaza Reports, Plaza Studies, Social Life of the Street, and Vehicular Studies categories, among others. This lack of consolidation, true to the original order of the files, sheds light on Whyte's work process as well as his organizational style.</p><p>The distinctions between sections with similar titles are also vague or minor. This is true of the Plaza Report and Plaza Studies headings, as well as the Films (General), Plaza Film, and New Film files. Additionally, some files maintain catch-all headings or headings that were meaningful to Whyte which may not be immediately comprehensible within the given context. Such ambiguity is exemplified by categories such as Books and Films and Grist.</p>  </arrangement>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The papers of urbanist, journalist, author and people-watcher William H. Whyte, which date from the mid-1940s to the early 1990s, relate primarily to his projects and research. The collection contains a vast amount of material on Whyte's work with easements as well as his various film projects. Materials on studies of pedestrian behavior and city dynamics conducted as part of the "Street Life Project", including Whyte's research on city social life as well as human and vehicular movement patterns, are also a prominent part of the collection.</p>  </scopecontent>
