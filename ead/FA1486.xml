    <head>Arrangement</head>
<p>The Social Science Research Council archives are arranged into three record groups distinguished by the date of their donation to the Archive Center. Accession 1 (Record Group 1) consists of the documents received by the Archive Center in 1990; Accession 2 (Record Group 2) was transferred to the Archive Center in 1994; Record Group 3 was transferred to the Archive Center in 2017-2018. </p><p>SSRC, RG 3, Series 6, Soviet Studies, is divided into four subseries: 1. Programs and Development; 2. Fellowship Records and Institutional Support; 3. Fellowship Records - Declinations (Graduate Training, Dissertation, and Postdoctoral); and 4. JCSSS and Eurasian Program. </p><p>These subseries divisions were created in the course of processing in order to facilitate access to the materials. There is overlap between subseries, however, and the divisions are not always exact.</p>  </arrangement>
