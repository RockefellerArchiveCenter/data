    <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
<p>Over the course of Nelson Rockefeller's tenure as Vice President of the United States, he served on several commissions, including the National Commission on Water Quality. Vice President Rockefeller also served as chair of the Domestic Council. The majority of Rockefeller's actions as Vice President are documented in this series of 63 volumes. They contain schedules, agenda and minutes of meetings, position papers, and memoranda and correspondence generated as part of the Vice President's daily activities.</p><p>Volumes 9 through 20 focus on Rockefeller's involvement with President Ford's Domestic Council, while documentation of the Vice President's meeings with President Ford are in Volumes 27 through 31. Volumes 50 through 60 contain press materials issued by the VP's office and transcripts of Rockefeller's speeches, television appearances, press conferences, as well as statements and press releases issued by his office. Of particular note in Volume 32 is documentation of the fiscal crisis that affected New York City and State. The majority of the information was provided by T. Norman Hurd, Special Assistant to Vice President Rockefeller. While Rockefeller was Governor of New York, Hurd served successively as Budget Director, Director of State Operations, and Secretary to the Governor.</p>  </scopecontent>
