<p>The Ford Foundation has been engaged in overseas work since the early 1950s. The Foundation's aspiration to become a national and international philanthropy for the advancement of human welfare was first formally expressed in the seminal 1949 report of the Gaither Study Committee, which was commissioned by the Board of Trustees to chart the future. In 1951, the Foundation established two of its first grant programs, Overseas Development (OD) and Overseas Training and Research (OTR). The granting goals were to increase agricultural production, improve health and living conditions, and advance education. South and Southeast Asia were the initial focus, with India and Pakistan receiving the majority of grants. A more limited number of grants were issued in Indonesia and Burma. A program for smaller regional and national grants also was initiated for the Near East. In 1957, Overseas Development further expanded to include programs in Latin America.</p><p>In 1957, the Foundation established a program in International Training and Research (ITR) the goal of which was to strengthen American competence in foreign affairs and international relations. ITR supported scholarship and teaching in areas where American knowledge and trained personnel were limited. The Foundation offered area studies in Asia, Africa, the Near East, the Soviet Union, and East Europe. In its international training and exchange programs, the Foundation and its grantees coordinated closely with the U.S. State Department, which sponsored exchanges between the United States and other countries as a matter of government policy.</p><p>During the first couple decades of the Foundation's existence the differentiation between program areas had yet to be established. According to the 1949 Gaithner Report that laid the groundwork for the Ford Foundation's work as an international philanthropy, the goal of Program Area One was the Establishment of Peace. This program had four parts: the mitigation of world tensions, the development of the understanding and conditions for peace among peoples of the world, the strengthening of the United Nations, and the improvement of both private and public American participation in world affairs. Much of the work of the Overseas Development Program therefore fell under the auspices of Program Area One.</p><p>As part of a Foundation reorganization in 1966, the Overseas Development Program, along with other international programs such as International Training and Research (ITR) and Population, became part of a single International Division (ID). A subsequent restructuring of the International Division occurred in 1980-1981 and led to the creation of the Developing Countries Program (DCP). DCP was again restructured in 1989, resulting in the separating of programs in Africa and the Middle East (AME, formerly MEA), Asia (ASIA), Latin American and the Caribbean (LAC/OLAC), Human Rights and Governance (HRG), Education and Culture (EC), Program-Related Investments (PRI), and International Affairs (IA) as independent program areas.</p>  </bioghist>

<p>Melvin J. Fox was born on November 26, 1913 and graduated from American University in 1940 with a B.A. in International Economics. He joined the Ford Foundation in July 1951 as a consultant on international affairs and served as part of its charter staff. In November of the same year he became a staff associate and, in 1953, he advanced to Executive Associate for International Training and Research (ITR). Mr. Fox was promoted to Program Associate in October of 1957 and he served as Associate Director of the International Training and Research Program from 1961 through 1966. In early 1967, he became Program Officer for Planning and Evaluation in the International Division, and later that year was promoted to Deputy Representative for West Africa within the Middle East and Africa (MEA) Program. Mr. Fox subsequently held the positions of Program Officer for the Middle East and Africa (1970) and Program Advisor for MEA (1972) before rising to Representative for West Africa in May 1975. From September 5 to November 2, 1983, he became Acting Representative for the Developing Countries Program in Lagos, Nigeria. During his time at Ford, his work focused on foreign academic exchange, the teaching of the English language abroad, development projects in Africa, and African studies at U.S. Universities. Mr. Fox died in 1998.</p><p>Herbert Passin was born in Chicago on December 16, 1916 and graduated from the University of Illinois with a B.A. in Genetics. Later, in 1941, he received a B.A. and a M.A. in Anthropology from Northwestern University.</p><p>When World War II broke out, Mr. Passin learned Japanese at an army language school, and in December 1945, served as chief of the Public Opinion and Sociological Research Division in General MacArthur's headquarters in Tokyo. He later held positions at the University of California, the Social Science Research Council in Japan, Ohio State University, the Congress of Cultural Freedom, the University of Washington in Seattle, and Columbia University in New York.</p><p>The Ford Foundation hired Mr. Passin as a consultant for his expertise on Japan in 1962. He served as a program advisor during the Foundation's expansion into Japan. In 1967, Mr. Passin helped found the Shimoda Conference and the first U.S.-Japan parliamentary exchange program. He returned to Columbia University, where he chaired the Sociology Department from 1973 to 1977. He died on February 26, 2003 at the age of 86.</p>  </bioghist>

<p>The International Division Program Area One Files are an artificially created collection of records from the International Division (ID) and International Training and Research (ITR) spanning from 1953 to 1970. The collection consists of Field Office Files and portions of the subject files of two staff members, Herbert Passin and Melvin Fox.</p><p>The Field Office Files contain correspondence, memoranda and reports originating from the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) and South and Southeast Asia (SSEA) regional offices. The correspondence in the field office files relates to then-ongoing programs, such as the Foundation's support for the distribution of inter-uterine devices for birth control in India (1965-1966). Internal memoranda describe policy issues, from cost of living expenses for Foundation staff and local litigation over housing in Pakistan to Foundation policy on travel and study awards. Reports include one on a Foundation mission to Mexico (1964) and an economic and development report on India (1964). The subject files of Melvin Fox contained in this collection primarily pertain to a Language Development Study (1966-1967). The study researched the best method for teaching languages, particularly foreign or second languages. The correspondence associated with the study reveals some of the academic disputes over the findings.</p><p>Herbert Passin, an expert on Japan who served as a program advisor for the Foundation's expansion into Asia, is one of the few consultants whose files have been retained. His subject files focus on education and cooperation between the United States and Japan, including basic dockets on the Foundation's Japan program (1963-1966) and support for English as a Second Language (1966).</p>  </scopecontent>

<p>Segment One: International Activities of the Ford Foundation: An Overview</p><p>
The Foundation's aspiration to become a national and international philanthropy for the advancement of human welfare was first formally expressed in the seminal 1949 report of the Gaither Study Committee, Report of the Study for the Ford Foundation on Policy and Program (RAC Library, call letters 361.7 GAI ), which was commissioned by the Board of Trustees to chart the Foundation's future. Foundation Trustees launched Ford's international grantmaking activities in 1950 when they approved the committee's report and its embrace of peace, democracy, and freedom.  Since then, the Foundation has tackled these goals using a variety of strategies and responding to changing contexts, from the Cold War to the 1989 fall of the Berlin Wall and beyond.</p><p>
Toward the Foundation's aspiration‎al goal, "the establishment of peace", its international activities have comprised a wide range of conceptual approaches and focus areas. These include international affairs, international studies, international understanding, arms control and disarmament, international law, international economic concerns, and overseas development in nearly every region of the world. Three distinct periods emerge for the international grantmaking defined by external contextual changes and internal changes in Foundation leadership and structures: the expansion era of 1950-1965; the transition and restructuring years of 1966-1988; and the post-1989 shift away from Cold War dichotomies.  During each of the distinct historical periods the consistent objectives were: 1) to ensure freedom and democracy in developed countries; 2) to foster education and international understanding in all countries; and 3) to contribute to the social, economic, and political development of less developed countries.</p>  </bioghist>

<p>Segment 2.  Period Summary - The Expansion Era 1950-1965</p><p>
With the ever-increasing budget and trustee willingness to invade capital, presidents Hoffman, Gaither and Heald oversaw vast growth in the Foundation's international activities in the United States, other developed countries and developing countries. Activities crossed disciplines, institutions, and national boundaries, although few crossed intra-foundation boundaries. Under the three presidents, Foundation staff in various domestic and international offices from New York interacted with the regional and country offices headed by representatives. Usually in this period, however, these offices in fact worked more closely with local governments than with New York staff, reinforcing the commitment to locally led social and economic development in less-developed countries.</p><p>
The shared values of this early period reflected as much the continuing competition between the Communist and capitalist worlds as the concerns about maintaining peace. The Cold War provided the contextual continuity for grantmaking on the core themes of increasing American understanding of the rest of the world, building and strengthening connections not only with European and Asian democracies but also with Eastern European countries, the Soviet Union, China, and Cuba.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Segment 3. Period Summary - Transition and Restructuring 1966-1988</p><p>
During this era, the Foundation's earlier interest in business and the economy evolved into a commitment to improving conditions for people living on the margins of society. The Ford Foundation promoted advancements in women's rights around the globe and introduced micro-lending into grantmaking. At the same time, the economic issues that were shaping program strategies also affected the Foundation's assets. Severe cuts resulted in a significant restructuring of country programs and reduced budgets across all programs. </p><p>
Even with the cuts in country offices, in the 1970s Ford grantees in developing countries received approximately 80% of the International Division budget. The remaining fifth went to Population, Development Studies, and International Affairs. Although representing a much smaller piece, the International Security and Arms Control program from 1973 was the Foundation's most concerted effort to make meaningful inroads in disarmament and nuclear issues - those challenges most directly linked to the Foundation's historic concern for peace. By 1979, the Ford Foundation was the biggest funder of arms control as a field, both in the U.S. and overseas. </p>  </bioghist>
