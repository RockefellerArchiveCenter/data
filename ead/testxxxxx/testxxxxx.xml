      <head>Conditions Governing Access note</head>
      <p>Files for Ford Foundation grants made to institutions/organizations that have been closed/inactive for 10 years or more are open for scholarly research. In addition, there is a selection of 8 Grant Files which remain restricted from scholarly access.</p>
    </accessrestrict>
    <arrangement id="aspace_ref8">
      <head>Arrangement note</head>
      <p>Each Ford Foundation Grant and the corresponding Grant File is identified by a unique Program Action (PA) number. PA numbers begin with the year a grant was made (2-digits), followed by a sequential number within that year (4-digits).</p>
      <p>  For example: PA 55-0123 was the 123rd grant made in the year 1955. PA numbers are often typed or handwritten on Ford documents in the following format: 55-123 (year)-(####). However, the Ford Foundation’s grants database (LINKS) uses an 8-digit format for PA numbers: 05500123 (0YY#####).</p>
      <p>  Beginning in the 1970s the 4th digit in the 8-digit PA number was used to encode at least three different types of Ford grants:</p>
      <p>After the year 2000 a “1” is used as the first digit in the 8-digit PA number to signify the 21st century. For example the 123rd grant made in 2012 would be PA number 11200123.</p>
      <p>  Grant Files were not microfilmed in numerical order, and the Ford Foundation’s LINKS database must be used to identify on which microfilm reel (or reels) any specific Grant File is housed.</p>
    </arrangement>
    <otherfindaid id="aspace_ref13">
      <head>Other Finding Aids note</head>
      <p>Grant Files are indexed in the Ford Foundation’s grants database (LINKS). This database is not available to the public. The Ford Foundation Central Index cards, 1950-1996 (FA736) also provide indexing for Grant Files, and can be searched by institutional/organizational name, personal name, grant location, and subject. Grant Files from 1953 to 1974 are also listed by PA number in the Fund File Index.</p>
    </otherfindaid>
    <arrangement id="aspace_ref14">
      <head>Arrangement note</head>
      <p>Each Ford Foundation Grant File is arranged into 4 sections:</p>
      <p>  Section 1. BASIC DOCUMENTS: Program Action Forms Accepted Proposals Tax Forms an d Certifications Docket Excerpts Request for Grant Action (RGA) Grant Notification Letter &amp; Budget Terms of Grant Grant Acceptance Letter Supplementary Requests &amp; Agreements Modification Requests &amp; Agreements Section 2. PAYMENTS: Requests Letters Acknowledgments Section 3. REPORTS: Grant Status Report Forms Grantee Narrative and Financial Reports Section 4. CORRESPONDENCE: All other correspondence and material, in reverse chronological order</p>
      <p>  A possible 5th section, ‘ATTACHMENTS’, will contain copies of printed ephemera &amp; clippings related to the grant. Grant Files may also be followed by a ‘Grants Accounting File’ which summarizes the grant.</p>
      <p>  Also, early Grant Files (roughly 1950-1970) often include a CROSS REFERENCE sheet listing other grants made in a related subject or Program Area, and a ‘BIBLIOGRAPHY of GRANT-RELATED MATERIALS’ at the beginning of the file.</p>
