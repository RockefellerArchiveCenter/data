    <head>Immediate Source of Acquisition note</head>
<p>The papers of John D. Rockefeller 3rd were transferred to the Archive Center from the Rockefeller family offices in Manhattan. Series 1 (Office of the Messrs. Rockefeller Files) and Series 2 (Rockefeller Family and Associates Files) were maintained within the general files department and the archives, the departments responsible for recordkeeping in the family office. The majority of the material designated as Series 3 (Office and Home Files) was maintained in the personal office and homes of Mr. Rockefeller until his death in 1978.</p>  </acqinfo>

    <head>Arrangement</head>
<p>The papers of John D. Rockefeller 3rd are divided into three series: </p><p>Series 1 - Office of the Messrs. Rockefeller Files, (1906-1961)-1969.</p><p>Series 2 - Rockefeller Family and Associates Files, 1942-(1962-1977). </p><p>Series 3 - Office and Home Files, 1928-(1955-1978).</p><p>Series 4 - Audiovisual materials.</p><p>Due to overlap in years and subject matter among the series, please consult the descriptions and folder listings for all three series when researching a topic.</p>  </arrangement>

    <head>Custodial History</head>
<p>Until the records were processed in final form, Series 1 was maintained at the Archive Center as a discrete series within the Rockefeller Family Archives, RG 2 (Office of the Messrs. Rockefeller, 1897-1961); Series 2 was maintained and described as part of the long alphabetical sequence of files that constitutes the Rockefeller Family Archives, RG 3 (Rockefeller Family &amp; Associates, 1962-1978). The archives department of the family office discontinued RG 3 following the death of Mr. Rockefeller 3rd. The current series titles in the John D. Rockefeller 3rd Papers were carried forward from the previous classifications to emphasize this aspect of the provenance.</p><p>The general files department created and maintained a card index for the records transferred to the department. This practice continued until the end of 1996. Indexed material was given a markup--either an arbitrary number or a brief title--that was then entered on the relevant index card. This card index, which can be consulted, contains references to specific documents and is not exhaustive. To facilitate use of the index card file, original folder titles have largely been retained except where doing so would hinder access.</p><p>Series 3 is, for the most part, composed of material that was not maintained by general files. It includes material that was kept for then-current use in the office and homes of John D. Rockefeller 3rd by Mr. Rockefeller and his associates. It also includes accretions transferred to the Archive Center in the years following the deaths of Mr. and Mrs. Rockefeller, among them files from the office of Joyce Tait, Mr. Rockefeller's personal secretary, and files used by Peter Johnson, an associate of Mr. Rockefeller, in his preparation of the two-volume biography of John D. Rockefeller 3rd that he coauthored with John Harr.</p>  </custodhist>
