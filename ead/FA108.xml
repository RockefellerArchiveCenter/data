    <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
<p>The papers of John D. Rockefeller 3rd (1906-1978), document Rockefeller's life and philanthropic activities. They provide information on his education; relationships with family, friends, and business associates; travels; and social concerns, including his lifelong involvement in four major areas: population, Asia, philanthropy, and the arts. The records document his concern for the projects and institutions he initiated and developed.</p>  </scopecontent>

<p>The papers of John D. Rockefeller 3rd were transferred to the Archive Center from the Rockefeller family offices in Manhattan. Series 1 (Office of the Messrs. Rockefeller Files) and Series 2 (Rockefeller Family and Associates Files) were maintained within the general files department and the archives, the departments responsible for recordkeeping in the family office. The majority of the material designated as Series 3 (Office and Home Files) was maintained in the personal office and homes of Mr. Rockefeller until his death in 1978.</p>  </acqinfo>

<p>The papers of John D. Rockefeller 3rd are divided into three series: </p><p>Series 1 - Office of the Messrs. Rockefeller Files, (1906-1961)-1969.</p><p>Series 2 - Rockefeller Family and Associates Files, 1942-(1962-1977). </p><p>Series 3 - Office and Home Files, 1928-(1955-1978).</p><p>Series 4 - Audiovisual materials.</p><p>Due to overlap in years and subject matter among the series, please consult the descriptions and folder listings for all three series when researching a topic.</p>  </arrangement>

    <head>Custodial History</head>
<p>Until the records were processed in final form, Series 1 was maintained at the Archive Center as a discrete series within the Rockefeller Family Archives, RG 2 (Office of the Messrs. Rockefeller, 1897-1961); Series 2 was maintained and described as part of the long alphabetical sequence of files that constitutes the Rockefeller Family Archives, RG 3 (Rockefeller Family &amp; Associates, 1962-1978). The archives department of the family office discontinued RG 3 following the death of Mr. Rockefeller 3rd. The current series titles in the John D. Rockefeller 3rd Papers were carried forward from the previous classifications to emphasize this aspect of the provenance.</p><p>The general files department created and maintained a card index for the records transferred to the department. This practice continued until the end of 1996. Indexed material was given a markup--either an arbitrary number or a brief title--that was then entered on the relevant index card. This card index, which can be consulted, contains references to specific documents and is not exhaustive. To facilitate use of the index card file, original folder titles have largely been retained except where doing so would hinder access.</p><p>Series 3 is, for the most part, composed of material that was not maintained by general files. It includes material that was kept for then-current use in the office and homes of John D. Rockefeller 3rd by Mr. Rockefeller and his associates. It also includes accretions transferred to the Archive Center in the years following the deaths of Mr. and Mrs. Rockefeller, among them files from the office of Joyce Tait, Mr. Rockefeller's personal secretary, and files used by Peter Johnson, an associate of Mr. Rockefeller, in his preparation of the two-volume biography of John D. Rockefeller 3rd that he coauthored with John Harr.</p>  </custodhist>

Rockefeller 3rd's birth, education, engagement, wedding, club memberships, wartime naval service, art collection, and real estate properties. Surviving childhood and school papers include coloring books, autograph collection, notebooks, yearbooks, and examinations. This subseries also contains the congratulatory notes (folder 12) received by JDR 3rd's parents at the time of his birth (including a telegram from Andrew Carnegie), as well as the condolences Rockefeller received upon the death of his grandfather, John D. Rockefeller, Sr., in 1937 (folder 158) and of his mother, Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, in 1948 (folders 149-151). Correspondence with John Foster Dulles and handwritten notes document Rockefeller's refusal of the ambassadorship to Indonesia in 1956 (folder 116). News clippings and magazine articles (folders 21-29) on topics of interest to Rockefeller as well as a scrapbook (box 21) that contains clippings about him can also be found in this subseries. Rockefeller's personal diaries from 1920 to 1961 (folders 36-72) are a valuable source of information. Begun at the age of 13 as a record of people, time, and events, the diaries offer a mixture of the routine interlaced with revealing personal insights. In December 1929, when Rockefeller began working in his father's office at 26 Broadway, the format of the diaries changed from handwritten to typescript. At that point, the diaries became more reflective of his business rather than his personal life.</p></scopecontent><relatedmaterial id="aspace_f09ce682da5453be7eea734c430a7a44"><head>Related Archival

This subseries includes the letters to Rockefeller from his mother, wife, siblings, and other extended family (Rockefeller and Hooker) members. Of special note is the correspondence between Rockefeller and his father (folders 287-300), which reveals much about their relationship, most especially JDR 3rd's drive to please his father. Other correspondents include Rockefeller's girlfriends and female acquaintances (such as Anne Colby, Alida Milliken, Elizabeth "Pete" Peterson, and Betty Stickney) and school chums, some of whom became lifelong friends (William Cochran, Douglas Dillon, Douglas Robertson, Bob Russell, and Latimer Stewart, among others).

Rockefeller was deeply concerned about the need for increasing America's understanding and appreciation of the peoples of Asia. To that end, he was involved in the support of cultural exchange programs; the revival of the Japan Society; the formation of the Asia Society; the construction of Asia House, the Asia Society's New York City headquarters; and the construction of the International House of Japan in Tokyo. The files documenting the teaching of the English language in Japan (folders 452-455) reflect Rockefeller's belief in the importance of English to Japan's growth in the international community. Also included here are files relating to the Council on Economic and Cultural Affairs, Inc. (CECA), an organization established by Rockefeller in 1953 to stimulate and support economic and related activities focusing on Asia. Rockefeller's work for the John Foster Dulles peace mission to Japan in 1951 led to a renewed acquaintance with Shigeharu Matsumoto, with whom he had worked at the Institute of Pacific Relations conference in 1929. The Matsumoto and Rockefeller families became close friends. Included in this subseries are Rockefeller's report for Dulles and the State Department (folder 446), as well as correspondence between Matsumoto and JDR 3rd (folders 477-478). Also represented here are two commercial ventures developed by Rockefeller to sell in the United States quality merchandise manufactured in Asia, namely, Products of Asia, Inc. and Products of India, Inc.

His role in the early stages of planning the Center, as well as the myriad details involved in its construction, are documented here. The records demonstrate Rockefeller's ability to forge a partnership among federal, state, and city officials and private philanthropists. As president (and later chair) of Lincoln Center, Rockefeller was responsible for all details of the project, including acquisition of the property, architecture and construction, public relations, seating capacities, and, most importantly, fundraising from both foreign and domestic donors. Due to considerable effort on Rockefeller's part, the Center raised more than $175 million in contributions and grants during its formative years.</p></scopecontent><relatedmaterial

Rockefeller 3rd developed an interest in the topic of population during his work for the Bureau of Social Hygiene. Rockefeller, who in speeches consistently linked population control to quality of life, became an acknowledged world leader in combating overpopulation. In addition to the files that reveal Rockefeller's general concern regarding the population issue (folders 667-670), this subseries documents the 1951 Conference on Population Problems (folders 718-723) held at Colonial Williamsburg, which was convened by Rockefeller and led to the founding of the Population Council, Inc., a year later. The subseries also sheds light on the early work of the Population Council, an organization founded by Rockefeller to fund biological and demographic research and training fellowships.</p></scopecontent><c id="5f8085cf80ae48dba90ca40dd64ac7d0" level="file"><did><unittitle>General</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1952/1961" type="inclusive">1952-1961</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="9bc6f7cd11f745f77bd631938461c9f5" label="mixed materials [A0000000048029]" type="box">80</container><container id="c272ecc7835a286452e6d3236b722ffb" parent="9bc6f7cd11f745f77bd631938461c9f5" type="folder">667-670</container></did></c><c id="a4363074f74a463a86dc136740b9ca9f" level="file"><did><unittitle>Japan -

Of note in this subseries are Rockefeller's record of his college graduation world tour in 1929 (folders 728-731); his General Education Board field trips, 1940-1947 (folders 733-734); and the trips to Europe, the Far East, and Africa undertaken on behalf of the Rockefeller Foundation. The field trips undertaken with other GEB trustees involved a study of poverty, race relations, and education in the rural South, notably Georgia, Mississippi, and Arkansas. Also documented here are Rockefeller's annual mid-winter visits to Asia, which began in 1951. With his travels, Rockefeller intended to gain firsthand knowledge of a region's economic and social conditions. To that end, he traveled extensively in Asia, Europe, and Africa. His diaries and logs contain observations on the cultures, societies, and people of the various countries he visited.</p></scopecontent><c id="449cf51cab63420f90f3f3f58b4af6d0" level="file"><did><unittitle>General</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1935/1962" type="inclusive">1935-1962</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="3b1e74e9462d1d9a4770ad5043ac14f1" label="mixed materials [A0000000048035]" type="box">86</container><container id="64943c947c392ff36e93bf0795816f01" parent="3b1e74e9462d1d9a4770ad5043ac14f1" type="folder">724</container></did></c><c id="98830175086f400cab475541e1bbb7bf" level="file"><did><unittitle>Trips -

It also contains reading copies and drafts of speeches given (folders 45-123) and statements made (folders 367-371) by Rockefeller between 1964 and 1976.

Wright Patman's House Ways and Means Committee during hearings on the 1969 Tax Reform Bill (folder 367-368). In his testimony, Rockefeller offered his views on the impact the new tax proposals would have on the state of philanthropy.

Of note is the continuation (1962-1978) of the diaries begun in series 1, subseries 1. Also included here are appointment books from 1956 to 1978, which list meeting schedules and participants, along with an occasional reference to the subject to be discusses, as well as telephone logs from 1954 to 1969, which list details of phone calls made or received by Rockefeller. Two sets of index cards containing information on acquaintances, American and foreign business leaders and government officials, and countries are also in this subseries (boxes 16-25). Material related to Rockefeller's extensive art collection including correspondence with galleries, museums, and Edgar P. Richardson, his advisor on American paintings, is also part of this subseries (folders 22-54). While these files do contain some information on his Asian art collection, the bulk of the material on Asian art in this series can be found in subseries 5 (folders 514-519). Records pertaining to the death of JDR 3rd are also contained in this subseries. Condolence letters received by his wife, his son, and the various organizations with which he was associated, as well as a memorial service program and booklet, are filed here (folders 58-74).</p></scopecontent><c id="8ac52fcd2b00466182ece9f94ef5c291" level="file"><did><unittitle>Appointment Books</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1956/1959" type="inclusive">1956-1959</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="86f52874ec7c70851d418ac1f1e0a263" label="mixed materials [A0000000048099]" type="box">1</container><container id="4c18a4a9679f5948916f1d371098572e" parent="86f52874ec7c70851d418ac1f1e0a263" type="folder">1-4</container></did></c><c id="439bc7cda6ab4ae3a08d48a129b9f26c" level="file"><did><unittitle>Appointment Books</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1959/1962" type="inclusive">1959-1962</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="bdf4f2da91ee28dde76984c7aa775d4a" label="mixed materials [A0000000048100]" type="box">2</container><container id="f5fa7861a9dbd20b18afb9472a0c7dc2" parent="bdf4f2da91ee28dde76984c7aa775d4a" type="folder">5-8</container></did></c><c id="1270a843416b4b3e8a62ecded2faa542" level="file"><did><unittitle>Appointment Books</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1963/1966" type="inclusive">1963-1966</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="77df4d2a1b3f45432ae6430b991dc57d" label="mixed materials [A0000000048101]" type="box">3</container><container id="2571bdf6ba28c25a532d0a5968a611ea" parent="77df4d2a1b3f45432ae6430b991dc57d" type="folder">9-12</container></did></c><c id="9dc66e5a0b38416e8643680f1be3a67e" level="file"><did><unittitle>Appointment Books</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1967/1970" type="inclusive">1967-1970</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="f8757d39a2c172b651241d021a1dbdc7" label="mixed materials [A0000000048102]" type="box">4</container><container id="063e91a0fd760ab9f0b7dbd1ad5aaff8" parent="f8757d39a2c172b651241d021a1dbdc7" type="folder">13-16</container></did></c><c id="255a539421244a18b1688970b25b159e" level="file"><did><unittitle>Appointment Books</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1971/1974" type="inclusive">1971-1974</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="7d5705ff97b0f72ec7b4254ebd5b3e46" label="mixed materials [A0000000048103]" type="box">5</container><container id="a8921b83c0f4c0f8c7cb4708a95feab8" parent="7d5705ff97b0f72ec7b4254ebd5b3e46" type="folder">17-20</container></did></c><c id="b67d490c1cb84b57af2743cef86310ac" level="file"><did><unittitle>Appointment Books</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1975/1978" type="inclusive">1975-1978</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="0472ce8a0094b3ca765a7a40b1e5f6b9" label="mixed materials [A0000000048104]" type="box">6</container><container id="007191b0cf717f68f59f30c131eae7ff" parent="0472ce8a0094b3ca765a7a40b1e5f6b9" type="folder">21-24</container></did></c><c id="a84aee1374c24dd3be084ebf38546640" level="file"><did><unittitle>Art Collection -

The personal correspondence contains incoming and outgoing letters from family members, friends, associates, and American and foreign government officials. The "Famous People" correspondents (folders 137-138) include Rosalyn Carter, Kurt Waldheim, and members of Congress and the presidential cabinets. Letters between Rockefeller and Charles Percy, John D. Rockefeller IV's father-in-law, reveal the warm relationship between the two families. Also located in this subseries are letters from Shigeharu Matsumoto and his family, close personal friends with whom the Rockefellers visited during their numerous trips to Japan. This section also contains correspondence between Rockefeller and his associates David K. Lelewer, Donald H. McLean, Jr., and Datus C. Smith, Jr. The chronological file contains copies of Rockefeller's outgoing correspondence from 1970 to 1978. The alphabetical file contains outgoing correspondence for the year 1978 filed by name of the recipient.</p></scopecontent><c id="a2ac531fd1254b5d818d13f0cfe93fa6" level="file"><did><unittitle>Personal</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1962/1964" type="inclusive">1962-1964</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="e4ac13a72efaffd33db290bea9615ec9" label="mixed materials [A0000000048128]" type="box">30</container><container id="b4a7fc4eb3ad70dce0679e6e8273559f" parent="e4ac13a72efaffd33db290bea9615ec9" type="folder">130</container></did></c><c id="cbbc4b6a2c65263437201e374d3eaf01" level="file"><did><unittitle>Personal</unittitle><unitdate calendar="gregorian" datechar="creation" era="ce" normal="1962/1964" type="inclusive">1962-1964</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="a4dea9ffec016ee846779ddcb85443be" label="mixed materials [A0000000048128]" type="box">30</container><container id="aa4586e19a80a2d16b06264c0ec1e97e" parent="a4dea9ffec016ee846779ddcb85443be" type="folder">131</container></did></c><c id="03c90060277943848f59deacd145bd5c" level="file"><did><unittitle>Personal</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1972/1975" type="inclusive">1972-1975</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="fb0caa821e483694c1dc7e21c78d61b4" label="mixed materials [A0000000048128]" type="box">30</container><container id="109cee3c3acd523c659d6be4a3af0d39" parent="fb0caa821e483694c1dc7e21c78d61b4" type="folder">132</container></did></c><c id="617f3ad875734a9e9ff144854db42151" level="file"><did><unittitle>Personal -

One of Rockefeller's earliest involvements was as chair of a Boys Bureau committee that studied the causes of juvenile delinquency. "Youth in the Toils" (folders 242-243), the culmination of the committee's six years of effort, was published in 1938. Also in this subseries are files relating to Colonial Williamsburg (folders 248-250). Rockefeller worked closely with his father on this restoration project, which is evidenced by their correspondence (folder 249). Rockefeller's involvement with the Rockefeller Foundation (folders 322-334) and with the Rockefeller Brothers Fund (folders 311-320) is also documented here.</p><p>Material that complements the Lincoln Center files in series 1 can be found in this subseries (folder 285-290). Of particular note is a 1977 interview conducted with Rockefeller adviser Edgar B. Young on JDR 3rd's role in the development of Lincoln Center. Rockefeller was also instrumental in the establishment of the Rockefeller Archive Center (folders 305-310) and the Rockefeller Public Service Awards (folders 335-343), which honor civilian employees in the Federal government. The collaborative efforts of Rockefeller, John E. Harr, Datus C. Smith, and Richard Schickel in the writing of "The Second American Revolution" are extensively documented in drafts, correspondence, and memoranda (folders 344-398).</p><p>In addition to material on the JDR 3rd Fund and its Arts in Education Program (folders 282-284), this subseries contains a number of files on the Youth Task Force. Established by the JDR 3rd Fund in 1970 to promote understanding among youth, business, and professional leaders, the Task Force sponsored a series of dialogs and underwrote surveys by Daniel Yankelovich, Inc. (folders 427-435). As a result of Wright Patman's attacks on philanthropy, Rockefeller became a lobbyist on its behalf. Numerous elements of this subseries reflect his efforts to protect, reform, and enhance philanthropy in the United States. Related material will be found under the headings "Corporate giving" (folders 264-267); "Tax reform" (folders 399-404); and "Third sector" (folders 406-419). Rockefeller's search to find methods of partnership between philanthropy, on the one hand, and government and private enterprise on the other hand, led to the creation of the Commission on Foundations and Private Philanthropy ("Peterson Commission," folders 251-254) and the Commission on Private Philanthropy and Public Needs ("Filer Commission," folders 254-260).</p></scopecontent><c id="95d40158d8174cab94e4a3ea9bfac7c1" level="file"><did><unittitle>Agricultural Development Council -

and international population movement during the 1970s. In 1972, President Richard Nixon appointed Rockefeller chair of the National Commission on Population Growth and the American Future. The commission, which had been created by Congress, was charged with making recommendations regarding a broad range of population issues. The work of the commission and its findings are documented in this subseries. A number of files in this subseries reveal Rockefeller's strong interest in the abortion debate, an interest that predated the Supreme Court's 1973 "Roe v. Wade" decision. After the decision, Rockefeller and Joan Dunlop, his adviser on population and on the status of women, attempted to develop strategies to influence public opinion in favor of access to contraceptive and abortion services.</p><p>This subseries also contains material on the operation and fundraising efforts of the Population Council. Of special note is Frederick Osborn's 1969 interview regarding Rockefeller's role in the founding and development of the Pop Council (folder 494). Rockefeller's correspondence with the Vatican (folder 511), as well as his efforts on behalf of the United Nations' World Leaders' Statement on Population (folder 513), for which he obtained the signatures of more than 30 world leaders, is also in this subseries.</p></scopecontent><c id="3f73cf6fccb142cc897055521b796c57" level="file"><did><unittitle>Abortion</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1970/1973" type="inclusive">1970-1973</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="58fdc907edba21430d176fe0f9237294" label="mixed materials [A0000000048165]" type="box">67</container><container id="c5449129d83ad5c9cc54d78d7d307443" parent="58fdc907edba21430d176fe0f9237294" type="folder">436</container></did></c><c id="5b0745dee96e4307a1591ba02e479867" level="file"><did><unittitle>Abortion - Articles on</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1976/1976" type="inclusive">1976</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="5bbc1e41177bc15014215aafeb76973d" label="mixed materials [A0000000048165]" type="box">67</container><container id="5640331f0e672361dbe59d71e2873ce4" parent="5bbc1e41177bc15014215aafeb76973d" type="folder">437</container></did></c><c id="06ba8b1858ec4bc394fb4c88ab8a4472" level="file"><did><unittitle>Abortion - Contributions</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1966/1978" type="inclusive">1966-1978</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="e9baa2c97c5e7b781f8fc10892a6d107" label="mixed materials [A0000000048165]" type="box">67</container><container id="e65e933822d8098b16634d672cd54792" parent="e9baa2c97c5e7b781f8fc10892a6d107" type="folder">438</container></did></c><c id="8ce415216b1e4e3bbbfc7624c47b745f" level="file"><did><unittitle>Abortion - Newsclippings</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1977/1978" type="inclusive">1977-1978</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="3f62c4af34215459337a8f7aafdd4f9f" label="mixed materials [A0000000048165]" type="box">67</container><container id="f1325c56f16bd55a82aa2c6a2d52f906" parent="3f62c4af34215459337a8f7aafdd4f9f" type="folder">439</container></did></c><c id="5cf35f4b8a614510a51fa9b494a00d6e" level="file"><did><unittitle>Abortion - "Newsweek" Article Reaction</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1976/1976" type="inclusive">1976</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="8e6851930248f7a733dc3f4a72adf58b" label="mixed materials [A0000000048165]" type="box">67</container><container id="1574f96ba8d2531d70484de6faf6b35f" parent="8e6851930248f7a733dc3f4a72adf58b" type="folder">440</container></did></c><c id="9283b5cd29a54eaa9b0633582162a349" level="file"><did><unittitle>Abortion - Support of Groups and Studies</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1969/1973" type="inclusive">1969-1973</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="07c63f5cbb087bbbb9a914f8977e6708" label="mixed materials [A0000000048165]" type="box">67</container><container id="e730c14d24105e72c1202dd4feb3fe00" parent="07c63f5cbb087bbbb9a914f8977e6708" type="folder">441</container></did></c><c id="8d76cb6e9ca74614b0c32cae09e9fdfe" level="file"><did><unittitle>Abortion - U.S. Coalition for Life</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1974/1974" type="inclusive">1974</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="eda09c19606a2e6177f83ea77603b0bb" label="mixed materials [A0000000048165]" type="box">67</container><container id="bdb8ee7b16d8efbe83e3fcf25bafd98d" parent="eda09c19606a2e6177f83ea77603b0bb" type="folder">442</container></did></c><c id="6e75ecf8eded4410af7c4b87afb626f9" level="file"><did><unittitle>Background Material</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1969/1975" type="inclusive">1969, 1970-1971, 1975</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="7d81afc122b31041915549c0a966c13e" label="mixed materials [A0000000048165]" type="box">67</container><container id="1aef33b2ce0b9a004b0017e92807f7a3" parent="7d81afc122b31041915549c0a966c13e" type="folder">443-444</container></did></c><c id="7bff134feb5a4253bf150780bd2313c1" level="file"><did><unittitle>China</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1972/1977" type="inclusive">1972-1977</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="11f744cb43a089c9d909b2bcc36c0996" label="mixed materials [A0000000048165]" type="box">67</container><container id="df72a7a15ce09543573f59f255bf7f5d" parent="11f744cb43a089c9d909b2bcc36c0996" type="folder">445</container></did></c><c id="cafaed1fb5f54ebcaae1ab9d2b86dc9d" level="file"><did><unittitle>Cleveland Program for Sexual Learning, Inc.

The files contain reading copies and drafts, as well as correspondence and memoranda relating to the preparation of speeches and to their reception when released or delivered. The speeches are a valuable resource for charting JDR 3rd's reactions to events and his involvement in numerous activities and causes. They can be used to trace Rockefeller's evolving views on such issues as population and philanthropy. In addition to speeches, this subseries includes Rockefeller's testimony before various congressional committees. Following the chronological arrangement of speeches, a separate, mostly redundant collation of "Speeches, Remarks, and Releases" will be found in boxes 96 through 98.</p></scopecontent><c

Of note is the typescript of the autobiography of Frederick T. Gates, "Chapters in My Life," which was given to Rockefeller by Gates's granddaughter, Janet Gates Bonney. Also found here are copies of Rockefeller's oral history interviews with Columbia University as well as reactions to publication of "The Rockefellers: An American Dynasty" by Peter Collier and David Horowitz.
