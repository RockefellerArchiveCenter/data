<p>The Ford Foundation was chartered by Henry and Edsel Ford in 1936 "to receive and administer funds for scientific, educational and charitable purposes, all for the public welfare", and initially served the Ford family's charitable interests in the Detroit area. Following the deaths of Edsel Ford (1943) and Henry Ford (1947), the Foundation was propelled to the forefront of philanthropy as the largest American foundation in terms of both endowment and yearly expenditures, and with an international scope to its major program areas. During the Foundation's first twenty years its major programs were in international economic development, primary and higher education, educational and public broadcasting, behavioral sciences, civil liberties, urban development, fine arts and the humanities. The Ford Foundation also partnered with the Rockefeller Foundation in supporting agricultural development in South America, Africa, and Southeast Asia. Since the 1970s, the Foundation has also pioneered programs in women's rights, energy policy, micro-financing in under-developed countries, establishing human rights groups, and improving international HIV/AIDS education.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>Collection contains the office files that Robert Mayer created during his time as Officer-in-Charge of the Ford Foundation's Logistical Services unit. Logistical Services operated within the Foundation's Division of Administration and included both a Records Services and Buildings Services department. Materials in the collection appear to chiefly relate to Mayer's responsibilities over the Records Services department as well as his involvement in the larger activities of the Division of Administration.</p><p>
The collection consists of one series of staff subject files. These files contain correspondence, memos, notes, drafts, and reports that document the development of the Ford Foundation's records management and archives programs from between the 1950s and 1970s. Prominent records management related subjects that the files discuss include trips to the field offices to evaluate and assist record keeping procedures, advancement and advocacy of records retention policies, filing procedures instructions, and records storage. Prominent archives related subjects include the development of the Reports Control Center (Ford catalogued reports collection), the oral history project, and policies for internal and external access to records.</p><p>
While some of the other material in the collection may have been accumulated by Mayer simply in his capacity as an officer in the Division of Administration receiving documents related to activities outside of his specific unit, other records were created through his active participation in concerns beyond Logistical Services. A notable example of the later type of material is Mayer's work on the Ford Foundation's response to the U.S. House of Representatives' Staff Report of the Subcommittee on Domestic Finance of the Committee on Banking and Currency (Patman Subcommittee Report).</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Robert A. (Anthony) Meyer built a career in administration that spanned across philanthropy, business, and the military. He worked in the Ford Foundation's Division of Administration during the 1960s and 1970s as Assistant to the Vice President and Officer-in-Charge of Logistical Services.</p><p>
Mayer graduated from Fairleigh Dickinson University in 1955 with a degree in English. He then served as a Sergent in the United States Army for two years where he worked in Administration and Personnel. Before joining the Ford Foundation in 1963, he worked for the Mobil Oil Company as Program Supervisor for Service Stations in the Advertising Department.</p><p>
Mayer initially joined the Ford Foundation as a Program Assistant in the Latin America Program. Then in 1964, he became a Program Associate and shortly after in 1965, he became Assistant Representative to Brazil. Mayer moved to the Division of Administration in 1967 as Assistant to the President and had his responsibilities expanded in 1968 to also become Officer-in-Charge of Logistical Services. As Officer-in-Charge of Logistical Services, Mayer oversaw both the Building Services and Records Services departments.</p><p>
In 1967, Mayer earned a Master's degree in Government and International Relations from New York University.</p>  </bioghist>

These files chiefly concern Mayer's duties overseeing the development of the records management and archives programs by the Records Services department. They contain correspondence, memos, notes, drafts, and reports that discuss topics like trips to the field offices to evaluate and assist record keeping procedures, advancement and advocacy of records retention polices, filing procedures instructions, records storage, the development of the Reports Control Center (the Ford catalogued reports collection), the development of the oral history project, and policies for internal and external access to archival records. Materials show that Meyer worked closely with Records Services Manager Robert Williams to establish and structure the Foundation's records management and archives programs.</p><p>
Other records in the series document Meyer's participation in administrative concerns outside of Logistical Services. For instance, there are files showing Meyer's role in drafting the Ford Foundation's response to the U.S. House of Representatives' Staff Report of the Subcommittee on Domestic Finance of the Committee on Banking and Currency (Patman Subcommittee Report). Then there are some documents that Meyer likely received simply because he was a member of the Division of Administration. These items are mostly reports and publications.</p></scopecontent><c id="b6816ff582bb234eabf4aabd859445ec" level="file"><did><unittitle>Risk management policy</unittitle><unitdate normal="1972/1972">1972</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="ba7fa87c249acb57107bdb9978fc206d" label="mixed materials [A0000000118365]" type="box">1</container><container id="eaa150b3b5b4a011ad703d00e736b6ac" parent="ba7fa87c249acb57107bdb9978fc206d" type="folder">1</container></did></c><c id="fa5e221bb6b8074c8f194508183c380c" level="file"><did><unittitle>Program-Directed Investments: A Wider View of Philanthropy</unittitle><unitdate normal="1968/1968">1968 March</unitdate><container altrender="Letter Document Box" id="23c6bc9ef331ceae6524bd8a9a93df41" label="mixed materials [A0000000118365]" type="box">1</container><container id="226dd25ebaf3c618f693387a0cce71d2" parent="23c6bc9ef331ceae6524bd8a9a93df41" type="folder">2</container></did></c><c id="e7e095ebee974aa06c1739a051bcfe17" level="file"><did><unittitle>Insurance Report for the Ford Foundation -
