    <abstract id="4044fb0ed373982e63bf3a0c0fc042d5">The Urban Poverty (UP) Program was established as a subdivision of the United States and International Affairs Program (USIAP) in October 1981, taking over programs formerly administered by the divisions of National Affairs and Education and Public Policy. It administered programs benefiting the poor and inner-city residents in areas that included community development, employment and training, welfare, teen pregnancy, poverty, crime, and precollege education. In 1988, UP became a program area within a newly organized Program Division and in 1996, was merged into the Asset Building and Community Development Program (ASSETS). Bernard McDonald joined the Ford Foundation National Affairs Division in 1978 as a Program Officer in Social Development. He then served as Program Officer In Charge/Director of Urban Poverty from 1981 to1987. In 1987, he became Director of the Special Project in Community Development in the USIAP Office of the Vice President. His work in Urban Poverty focused on supporting the efforts of poor communities to build their own economic enterprises and building the economic capacities of minority individuals through education and job training. His files span in date from 1974 to 1989 and consist of correspondence, memoranda, proposals, reports, grantee and proposal evaluations, meeting materials, and background information documenting his work in Urban Poverty. The bulk of files concern the management of grants and Program Related Investments to community development corporations (CDCs). There are also files on the Minority Pipeline Task Force, the Rural America Task Force, and the Refugee and Migrants Task Force as well as on the subject of Human Rights and Governance and the Foundation's Physical, Economic and Social Revitalization strategy area.</abstract>

<p>The work of what became the Urban Poverty Program began when the Public Affairs Program was formally established in 1952. One of the goals of the new program was to work toward greater equality of opportunity for minority groups. In 1965, Public Affairs was succeeded by the National Affairs Division, created to focus on deep-rooted problems facing American society. Program areas under the National Affairs Division included Social Development and Urban and Metropolitan Development. In 1981, a reorganization of the Foundation replaced National Affairs with the United States and International Affairs Program (USIAP).</p><p>The Urban Poverty Program was established in October 1981 as a subdivision of USIAP, taking over programs formerly administered by the divisions of National Affairs and Education and Public Policy. It administered programs benefiting the poor and inner-city residents in areas that included community development, employment and training, welfare, teen pregnancy, poverty, crime, and precollege education. It also assumed oversight of the programs in Population and of new programs to combat infant and child mortality.

<p>Bernard McDonald graduated from Hunter College in 1964 with a B.A. in Economics and received an M.A. in Secondary Education from Brooklyn College in 1968. In 1979, he joined the Ford Foundation National Affairs Division as a Program Officer in Social Development. He then served as Program Officer In Charge/Director of Urban Poverty from 1981 to1987. In 1987, he became Director of the Special Project in Community Development in the United States and International Affairs Program (USIAP) Office of the Vice President. His work in Urban Poverty focused on supporting the efforts of poor communities to build their own economic enterprises and building the economic capacities of minority individuals through education and job training. To this end, sustaining and building the capacity of community development corporations (CDCs) committed to physical, economic, and social revitalization became a vital component of the Foundation's strategic approach to alleviating urban poverty. This was carried out through making long-term grants and Program Related Investments (PRIs) to numerous CDCs.</p><p>Mr. McDonald also served on the Ford Foundation Minority Pipeline, Rural America, and Refugee and Migrant task forces. The Minority Pipeline Task Force, later renamed the Committee to Improve the Professional Opportunities for Minorities, aimed to increase minority access to professional fields through implementing progressive affirmative action policies in the Foundation's grantmaking. Through the Task Force, the Foundation funded scholarships, internships and research opportunities for minority students and scholars. The Rural America Task Force was funded by a Delegated Authority Project (DAP) grant and was charged with improving agricultural productivity, irrigation, and opportunities for rural employment. The Refugee and Migrants Task Force focused on aiding refugees resettling in the United States, particularly from Haiti and Southeast Asia.</p><p>Mr. McDonald left the Foundation in October 1989 for a faculty position at the Pratt Institute. There, he directed the Ford Foundation-sponsored Community Development Corporation Oral History Project. He died in 1991 at age 49.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>

The collection consists of chron files, files on Program Related Investments, and files relating to his administering of grants and service on various task forces.</p><p>Many of the Grant-Related and Program Related Investment files pertain to the Foundation's support of community development corporations (CDCs), particularly the South East Alabama Self-Help Association (SEASHA), Mississippi Action for Community Education (MACE) and organizations in the South Bronx. Delegated Authority Project (DAP) grants and Program Related Investments (PRIs) constitute the bulk of the grant activity documented in the files.</p><p>Program and Grant-Related Files also include files on the Minority Pipeline Task Force (1985-1987), the Rural America Task Force (1980-1985), and the Refugee and Migrants Task Force (1982-1983).
