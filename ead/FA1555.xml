<p>The Agricultural Development Council, known as the Council on Economic and Cultural Affairs, Inc. during its first ten years, was established in 1953 by John D. Rockefeller 3rd as a "charitable, scientific and educational" organization that aimed "to stimulate and support economic and related activities important to human welfare." Its focus was Asia. From its beginning, the Council committed a major part of its resources to training and research activities in the social sciences, with the central aim of strengthening professional capacity to deal with the economic and human problems of agriculture and rural development in Asia. In 1985 it merged with two other Rockefeller-related agricultural programs, the Winrock International Livestock Research and Training Center and the Rockefeller Foundation's International Agricultural Development Service to create the Winrock International Institute for Agricultural Development.</p>  </bioghist>
